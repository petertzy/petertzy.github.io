    <p data-start="12.14" data-end="14.68" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十二章：尋找邪惡女巫</p>
    
    <p data-start="15.88" data-end="22.90">The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived.</p>
    <p data-start="15.88" data-end="22.90">綠鬍子的士兵帶著他們穿過翡翠城的街道，直到他們到達守門人居住的房間。</p>
    
    <p data-start="23.52" data-end="33.68">This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends. "Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="23.52" data-end="33.68">這名官員打開他們的眼鏡，將其放回他的巨大箱子裡，然後禮貌地為我們的朋友們打開了門。桃樂絲問道："哪條路通向西方的邪惡女巫？"</p>
    
    <p data-start="34.50" data-end="41.32">"There is no road," answered the Guardian of the Gates. "No one ever wishes to go that way."</p>
    <p data-start="34.50" data-end="41.32">"沒有路，"守門人回答道。"沒有人想走那條路。"</p>
    
    <p data-start="42.04" data-end="53.70">"How, then, are we to find her?" inquired the girl. "That will be easy," replied the man, "for when she knows you are in the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her slaves."</p>
    <p data-start="42.04" data-end="53.70">"那麼，我們該怎麼找到她呢？"女孩問道。 "這很容易，"那人回答，"因為當她知道你們在溫基國時，她會找到你們，並使你們都成為她的奴隸。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="54.68" data-end="63.60">"Perhaps not," said the Scarecrow, "for we mean to destroy her." "Oh, that is different," said the Guardian of the Gates.</p>
    <p data-start="54.68" data-end="63.60">"也許不會，"稻草人說，"因為我們打算消滅她。" "哦，那就不同了，"守門人說。</p>
  
    <p data-start="63.60" data-end="69.40">"No one has ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you, as she has of the rest.</p>
    <p data-start="63.60" data-end="69.40">"以前沒有人消滅過她，所以我自然認為她會像對待其他人一樣，把你們變成奴隸。</p>
  
    <p data-start="70.04" data-end="76.90">But take care; for she is wicked and fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her.</p>
    <p data-start="70.04" data-end="76.90">但要小心；因為她很邪惡且兇猛，可能不會讓你們消滅她。</p>
  
    <p data-start="76.92" data-end="90.18">Keep to the West, where the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her." They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West, walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups.</p>
    <p data-start="76.92" data-end="90.18">向西走，那裡太陽落山，你們一定會找到她。" 他們感謝他，與他告別，然後轉向西方，走過軟草地，草地上點綴著雛菊和毛茛。</p>
  
    <p data-start="90.32" data-end="110.34">Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer green, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto's neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy's dress.</p>
    <p data-start="90.32" data-end="110.34">桃樂絲仍然穿著她在宮殿裡穿上的漂亮絲綢裙子，但現在，令她驚訝的是，它不再是綠色的，而是純白色的。托托脖子上的絲帶也失去了綠色，和桃樂絲的裙子一樣白。</p>
  
    <p data-start="110.56" data-end="122.80">The Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West, and the ground was untilled.</p>
    <p data-start="110.56" data-end="122.80">翡翠城很快就被遠遠地拋在後面。隨著他們的前進，地面變得越來越崎嶇不平，因為這片西方的土地上沒有農田和房屋，土地也沒有被耕作。</p>
  
    <p data-start="122.92" data-end="144.36">In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.</p>
    <p data-start="122.92" data-end="144.36">下午，太陽炙烤著他們的臉，因為沒有樹木可以為他們遮蔭；所以在天黑之前，桃樂絲、托托和獅子就已經累了，他們躺在草地上睡著了，由鐵皮人和稻草人守夜。</p>
  
    <p data-start="144.36" data-end="174.20">Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.</p>
    <p data-start="144.36" data-end="174.20">現在西方的邪惡女巫只有一隻眼睛，但它像望遠鏡一樣強大，能夠看到任何地方。因此，當她坐在城堡的門口時，她碰巧環顧四周，看見桃樂絲躺在地上睡覺，朋友們都在她身邊。他們距離很遠，但邪惡女巫發現他們在她的國家，感到非常生氣；所以她吹響了掛在脖子上的銀哨子。</p>
  
    <p data-start="174.88" data-end="180.50">At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.</p>
    <p data-start="174.88" data-end="180.50">立刻，從四面八方跑來了一群大狼。牠們有著長長的腿、兇猛的眼睛和鋒利的牙齒。</p>
  
    <p data-start="181.28" data-end="185.28">"Go to those people," said the Witch, "and tear them to pieces."</p>
    <p data-start="181.28" data-end="185.28">"去找那些人，"女巫說，"把他們撕成碎片。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="186.38" data-end="214.42">"Are you not going to make them your slaves?" asked the leader of the wolves. "No," she answered, "one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into small pieces." "Very well," said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed by the others. It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming.</p>
    <p data-start="186.38" data-end="214.42">"你不打算讓他們成為你的奴隸嗎？"狼群的領袖問道。"不，"她回答，"一個是鐵皮做的，一個是稻草做的；一個是女孩，另一個是獅子。沒有一個適合工作，所以你可以把他們撕成碎片。" "很好，"狼說，然後全速衝了出去，其他的狼緊隨其後。幸運的是，稻草人和鐵皮人都醒著，聽到了狼群的到來。</p>
  
    <p data-start="215.44" data-end="222.56">"This is my fight," said the Woodman, "so get behind me and I will meet them as they come."</p>
    <p data-start="215.44" data-end="222.56">"這是我的戰鬥，"鐵皮人說，"所以你們站在我後面，我會在他們來時迎戰他們。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="223.22" data-end="254.16">He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf's head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman's weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="223.22" data-end="254.16">他抓起了他的斧頭，他已經把斧頭磨得非常鋒利，當狼群的領袖來到時，鐵皮人揮動手臂，將狼的頭從身體上砍下來，使它立即死亡。當他再次舉起斧頭時，另一隻狼又來了，它也倒在鐵皮人武器的鋒利邊緣下。有四十隻狼，四十次狼被殺死，最後它們都倒在鐵皮人面前的一堆死屍中。</p>
  
    <p data-start="255.26" data-end="264.10">Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, "It was a good fight, friend." They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning.</p>
    <p data-start="255.26" data-end="264.10">然後他放下斧頭，坐在稻草人旁邊，稻草人說："這是一場好戰鬥，朋友。" 他們等到桃樂絲第二天早上醒來。</p>
  
    <p data-start="264.66" data-end="272.10">The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodman told her all.</p>
    <p data-start="264.66" data-end="272.10">小女孩看到那堆毛茸茸的狼，非常害怕，但鐵皮人把一切都告訴了她。</p>
  
    <p data-start="272.80" data-end="278.76">She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.</p>
    <p data-start="272.80" data-end="278.76">她感謝他救了他們，然後坐下來吃早餐，之後他們再次上路。</p>
  
    <p data-start="279.64" data-end="299.70">Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle and looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her country. This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver whistle twice.</p>
    <p data-start="279.64" data-end="299.70">同一天早上，邪惡女巫來到她的城堡門口，用她那能看得很遠的獨眼向外看去。她看到所有的狼都死了，而陌生人仍然在她的國家旅行。這讓她比以前更生氣，她吹了兩次銀哨。</p>
  
    <p data-start="299.72" data-end="321.66">Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough to darken the sky. And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, "Fly at once to the strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces." The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions.</p>
    <p data-start="299.72" data-end="321.66">立刻，一大群野鴉飛向她，足以遮天蔽日。邪惡女巫對鴉王說："立即飛向那些陌生人；啄出他們的眼睛，將他們撕成碎片。" 野鴉成群結隊地飛向桃樂絲和她的同伴。</p>
  
    <p data-start="322.54" data-end="354.00">When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid. But the Scarecrow said, "This is my battle, so lie down beside me and you will not be harmed." So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up and stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare to come any nearer. But the King Crow said: "It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out."</p>
    <p data-start="322.54" data-end="354.00">小女孩看到它們來了，感到很害怕。但是稻草人說："這是我的戰鬥，所以躺在我旁邊，你們不會受到傷害。" 所以除了稻草人，他們都躺在地上，稻草人站起來伸展雙臂。當烏鴉們看到他時，像往常一樣被稻草人嚇到了，不敢再靠近。但是鴉王說："他只是一個填充人。我會啄出他的眼睛。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="354.02" data-end="379.28">The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and twisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and the Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead beside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they went upon their journey.</p>
    <p data-start="354.02" data-end="379.28">鴉王飛向稻草人，稻草人抓住它的頭，扭斷了它的脖子，直到它死去。然後另一隻烏鴉飛向他，稻草人也扭斷了它的脖子。有四十隻烏鴉，四十次稻草人扭斷了脖子，直到最後它們全都死在他旁邊。然後他叫他的同伴們起來，他們再次踏上了旅程。</p>
  
    <p data-start="380.44" data-end="400.30">When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her silver whistle. Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her.</p>
    <p data-start="380.44" data-end="400.30">當邪惡女巫再次向外看時，看到所有的烏鴉都堆成一堆，她變得非常憤怒，吹了三次銀哨。立刻，空中傳來巨大的嗡嗡聲，一群黑色的蜜蜂飛向她。</p>
  
    <p data-start="401.72" data-end="420.52">"Go to the strangers and sting them to death!" commanded the Witch, and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the Scarecrow had decided what to do.</p>
    <p data-start="401.72" data-end="420.52">"去找那些陌生人，把他們蜇死！"女巫命令道，蜜蜂們迅速轉身飛到桃樂絲和她的朋友們行走的地方。但是鐵皮人看到了它們的來臨，稻草人已經決定該怎麼做。</p>
  
    <p data-start="421.58" data-end="458.00">"Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and the Lion," he said to the Woodman, "and the bees cannot sting them." This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely. The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting the Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.</p>
    <p data-start="421.58" data-end="458.00">"把我的稻草拿出來，撒在小女孩、狗和獅子身上，"他對鐵皮人說，"蜜蜂就不能蜇他們了。" 鐵皮人照做了，當桃樂絲緊靠獅子躺下並抱著托托時，稻草完全覆蓋了他們。蜜蜂來了，發現除了鐵皮人外沒有人可以蜇，所以它們飛向他，把所有的刺都折斷在鐵皮上，完全沒有傷到鐵皮人。由於蜜蜂的刺斷了就活不了，這就是黑蜂的結局，它們像小堆的細煤一樣密密麻麻地散落在鐵皮人周圍。</p>
  
    <p data-start="458.02" data-end="494.52">Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as ever. So they started upon their journey once more. The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them.</p>
    <p data-start="458.02" data-end="494.52">桃樂絲和獅子站起來，小女孩幫助鐵皮人把稻草重新放回稻草人裡，直到他恢復如初。於是他們再次踏上了旅程。當邪惡女巫看到她的黑蜂像細煤一樣堆成小堆時，她非常生氣，跺腳、撕扯頭髮並咬牙切齒。然後她叫來一打奴隸，他們是溫基人，給了他們尖銳的長矛，讓他們去消滅那些陌生人。</p>
  
    <p data-start="494.54" data-end="513.46">The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.</p>
    <p data-start="494.54" data-end="513.46">溫基人不是勇敢的人，但他們必須按照指示行事。於是他們一直走到接近桃樂絲的地方。這時獅子發出一聲巨吼，向他們撲去，可憐的溫基人被嚇得拼命往回跑。</p>
  
    <p data-start="514.76" data-end="545.44">When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to think what she should do next. She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful Witch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to act.</p>
    <p data-start="514.76" data-end="545.44">當他們回到城堡時，邪惡女巫用皮帶狠狠地打了他們，然後把他們送回工作崗位。之後她坐下來思考下一步該怎麼做。她無法理解為什麼她所有摧毀這些陌生人的計劃都失敗了；但她是一個強大的女巫，也是一個邪惡的女巫，她很快就決定了如何行動。</p>
  
    <p data-start="545.44" data-end="611.72">There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given. But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.</p>
    <p data-start="545.44" data-end="611.72">在她的櫥櫃裡，有一頂金色的帽子，上面鑲嵌著一圈鑽石和紅寶石。這頂金色的帽子有一種魔力。擁有它的人可以召喚飛猴三次，飛猴會服從任何命令。但是，任何人都不能命令這些奇怪的生物超過三次。邪惡女巫已經兩次使用這頂帽子的魔力。一次是當她讓溫基人成為她的奴隸，並設法統治他們的國家時，飛猴幫助她完成了這件事。第二次是當她與偉大的奧茲本人戰鬥，並將他趕出西方之地時，飛猴也幫助她完成了這件事。她只能再用這頂金色帽子一次，因此她不願意在所有其他力量耗盡之前使用它。但是現在，她的凶猛的狼、野鴉和蜇人的蜜蜂都已經消失了，她的奴隸也被膽小的獅子嚇跑了，她看到只有一個辦法可以摧毀桃樂絲和她的朋友們。</p>
  
    <p data-start="612.66" data-end="621.34">So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:</p>
    <p data-start="612.66" data-end="621.34">於是，邪惡女巫從櫥櫃裡拿出金色帽子，戴在頭上。然後她站在左腳上，慢慢地說道：</p>
  
    <p data-start="622.22" data-end="626.90">"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" Next she stood upon her right foot and said:</p>
    <p data-start="622.22" data-end="626.90">"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" 接著她站在右腳上，說道：</p>
  
    <p data-start="627.38" data-end="634.66">"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:</p>
    <p data-start="627.38" data-end="634.66">"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" 之後她站在雙腳上，大聲喊道：</p>
  
    <p data-start="635.28" data-end="661.12">"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" Now the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling sound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and powerful wings on his shoulders.</p>
    <p data-start="635.28" data-end="661.12">"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" 現在魔法開始發揮作用了。天空變暗，空中傳來低沉的隆隆聲。有許多翅膀的急速拍動聲，還有大聲的喋喋不休和笑聲，太陽從黑暗的天空中出來，顯示出邪惡女巫被一群猴子包圍，每隻猴子肩膀上都有一對巨大的強壯翅膀。</p>
  
    <p data-start="662.28" data-end="671.10">One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew close to the Witch and said, "You have called us for the third and last time. What do you command?"</p>
    <p data-start="662.28" data-end="671.10">其中一隻，比其他的都大，似乎是他們的首領。他飛近女巫，說："你已經第三次也是最後一次召喚我們。你有何命令？"</p>
  
    <p data-start="671.88" data-end="688.60">"Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion," said the Wicked Witch. "Bring that beast to me, for I have a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work."</p>
    <p data-start="671.88" data-end="688.60">"去找那些在我國土內的陌生人，把他們全都消滅，除了獅子，"邪惡女巫說道。"把那頭野獸帶給我，因為我想把他當馬一樣套上韁繩，讓他幹活。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="689.80" data-end="697.78">"Your commands shall be obeyed," said the leader. Then, with a great deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place where Dorothy and her friends were walking.</p>
    <p data-start="689.80" data-end="697.78">"你的命令會被執行，"首領說道。然後，伴隨著大量的喋喋不休和噪音，飛猴飛向桃樂絲和她的朋友們行走的地方。</p>
  
    <p data-start="698.80" data-end="715.26">Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks. Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan.</p>
    <p data-start="698.80" data-end="715.26">一些猴子抓住了鐵皮人，將他帶到空中，直到他們飛到一個布滿尖銳岩石的地方。然後他們把可憐的鐵皮人扔下，他掉到岩石上，摔得遍體鱗傷，無法動彈也無法呻吟。</p>
  
    <p data-start="717.54" data-end="732.24">Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree.</p>
    <p data-start="717.54" data-end="732.24">另外一些猴子抓住了稻草人，用他們的長手指把稻草從稻草人的衣服和頭部拔出來。他們把稻草人的帽子、靴子和衣服捆成一小包，扔到一棵高大的樹的樹頂。</p>
  
    <p data-start="733.34" data-end="757.30">The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable to bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not escape.</p>
    <p data-start="733.34" data-end="757.30">剩下的猴子用粗繩子把獅子捆住，在他的身體、頭部和腿上纏繞了很多圈，直到他無法咬、抓或掙扎為止。然後他們把他抬起來，帶到女巫的城堡，把他放在一個四周有高鐵柵欄的小院子裡，以防他逃跑。</p>
  
    <p data-start="758.52" data-end="786.14">But Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms, watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead and stopped short, motioning the others not to touch her.</p>
    <p data-start="758.52" data-end="786.14">但他們並沒有傷害桃樂絲。她抱著托托站著，看著她的同伴們悲慘的命運，心想很快就會輪到她了。飛猴的首領飛到她面前，他那長長的毛茸茸的手臂伸出來，醜陋的臉上露出可怕的笑容；但他看到了她額頭上的好女巫的吻痕，立刻停了下來，示意其他人不要碰她。</p>
  
    <p data-start="787.00" data-end="813.80">"We dare not harm this little girl," he said to them, "for she is protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of Evil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave her there." So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they set her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the Witch:</p>
    <p data-start="787.00" data-end="813.80">"我們不敢傷害這個小女孩，"他對他們說，"因為她受到善良力量的保護，這力量比邪惡力量更強大。我們所能做的就是把她帶到邪惡女巫的城堡，把她留在那裡。" 於是，他們小心翼翼地把桃樂絲抱起來，迅速帶到空中，直到他們來到城堡，把她放在前門台階上。然後首領對女巫說：</p>
  
    <p data-start="814.22" data-end="840.12">"We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again." Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.</p>
    <p data-start="814.22" data-end="840.12">"我們已經盡力聽從你的命令。鐵皮人和稻草人被毀了，獅子被綁在你的院子裡。小女孩我們不敢傷害，她抱著的狗我們也不敢傷害。你對我們這群人的控制力現在結束了，你再也不會見到我們了。" 然後所有的飛猴都發出很多笑聲、喋喋不休的聲音和噪音，飛向空中，很快就消失不見了。</p>
  
    <p data-start="840.13" data-end="893.65">The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and thought, "I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to use her power." Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:</p>
    <p data-start="840.13" data-end="893.65">當邪惡女巫看到桃樂絲額頭上的印記時，她既驚訝又擔心，因為她很清楚，無論是飛猴還是她自己，都不敢以任何方式傷害這個女孩。她低頭看著桃樂絲的腳，看到銀鞋，開始因恐懼而顫抖，因為她知道這雙鞋有多強大的魔力。起初，女巫想逃離桃樂絲；但她恰好看到孩子的眼睛，看到眼睛背後那單純的靈魂，小女孩並不知道銀鞋給她帶來的神奇力量。於是邪惡女巫暗自笑了笑，心想："我仍然可以讓她成為我的奴隸，因為她不知道如何使用她的力量。" 然後她嚴厲地對桃樂絲說：</p>
  
    <p data-start="893.66" data-end="903.82">"Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow."</p>
    <p data-start="893.66" data-end="903.82">"跟我來；你必須服從我的每一個命令，否則我會像對待鐵皮人和稻草人那樣對待你。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="904.74" data-end="916.68">Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.</p>
    <p data-start="904.74" data-end="916.68">桃樂絲跟著她穿過城堡裡許多美麗的房間，直到他們來到廚房，女巫命令她清洗鍋碗瓢盆，掃地，並不斷給火爐添柴。</p>
  
    <p data-start="917.76" data-end="926.36">Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her.</p>
    <p data-start="917.76" data-end="926.36">桃樂絲順從地開始工作，她下定決心要盡可能努力工作；因為她很高興邪惡女巫決定不殺她。</p>
  
    <p data-start="927.20" data-end="951.46">With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again.</p>
    <p data-start="927.20" data-end="951.46">桃樂絲努力工作著，女巫想她可以去院子裡把膽小的獅子像馬一樣套上韁繩；她確信，每當她想要出去時，讓他拉她的戰車會讓她很開心。但是當她打開門時，獅子發出一聲巨吼，猛撲向她，把女巫嚇得跑了出去，並重新關上了門。</p>
  
    <p data-start="952.30" data-end="963.42">"If I cannot harness you," said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through the bars of the gate, "I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat until you do as I wish."</p>
    <p data-start="952.30" data-end="963.42">"如果我不能給你套上韁繩，"女巫透過門的欄杆對獅子說，"我可以餓死你。直到你按我希望的做，你才會有東西吃。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="964.10" data-end="978.21">So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day she came to the gate at noon and asked, "Are you ready to be harnessed like a horse?"</p>
    <p data-start="964.10" data-end="978.21">從那以後，她就不再給被囚禁的獅子送食物；但是每天中午她都會來到門口問："你準備好被像馬一樣套上韁繩了嗎？"</p>
  
    <p data-start="978.220" data-end="992.160">And the Lion would answer, "No. If you come in this yard, I will bite you." The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard.</p>
    <p data-start="978.220" data-end="992.160">獅子會回答說："不。如果你進來這個院子，我會咬你。" 獅子不必按照女巫的要求去做的原因是，每天晚上，當女巫睡覺時，桃樂絲會從櫥櫃裡給他帶食物。</p>
  
    <p data-start="992.160" data-end="1019.800">After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw, and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to escape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.</p>
    <p data-start="992.160" data-end="1019.800">他吃完飯後會躺在他的稻草床上，桃樂絲會躺在他旁邊，把頭靠在他柔軟的毛鬃上，他們談論著自己的困境，試圖策劃逃跑的方法。但是他們找不到辦法逃出城堡，因為城堡一直由黃色的溫基人守衛著，他們是邪惡女巫的奴隸，害怕女巫，不敢不聽從她的命令。</p>
  
    <p data-start="1019.800" data-end="1054.220">The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in return. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.</p>
    <p data-start="1019.800" data-end="1054.220">白天這個女孩不得不努力工作，女巫經常威脅要用她手中的那把舊傘打她。但是，事實上，她不敢打桃樂絲，因為她額頭上的印記。小女孩不知道這一點，對自己和托托充滿了恐懼。一次，女巫用傘打了托托一下，勇敢的小狗飛身撲向她，咬了她的腿。女巫被咬的地方沒有流血，因為她太邪惡了，血液在很多年前就已經乾涸了。</p>
  
    <p data-start="1055.340" data-end="1087.780">Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.</p>
    <p data-start="1055.340" data-end="1087.780">隨著桃樂絲意識到要回到堪薩斯和艾姆姨媽身邊比以往任何時候都難，她的生活變得非常悲慘。有時她會痛哭幾個小時，托托坐在她腳邊，望著她的臉，悲哀地嗚咽著，表達他對小主人深深的同情。托托其實並不在乎自己是在堪薩斯還是奧茲國，只要桃樂絲和他在一起；但他知道小女孩不快樂，這也讓他感到不快樂。</p>
  
    <p data-start="1088.560" data-end="1147.040">Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy was bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let water touch her in any way.</p>
    <p data-start="1088.560" data-end="1147.040">現在邪惡女巫非常渴望擁有這個女孩總是穿著的銀鞋。她的蜜蜂、烏鴉和狼群都已經堆積如山，逐漸乾枯，她已經用盡了金帽子的所有力量；但是如果她能抓住銀鞋，這將給她帶來比她失去的所有東西更大的力量。她仔細觀察桃樂絲，看她是否會脫下鞋子，心想她或許可以偷走它們。但是小女孩對她漂亮的鞋子非常自豪，除了晚上和洗澡時，她從不脫下它們。女巫太害怕黑暗，不敢在晚上進入桃樂絲的房間拿鞋子，而且她對水的恐懼比對黑暗的恐懼更大，所以當桃樂絲洗澡時，她從不靠近。事實上，這個老女巫從來不碰水，也不讓水以任何方式碰到她。</p>
  
    <p data-start="1147.900" data-end="1184.539">But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a trick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at full length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot.</p>
    <p data-start="1147.900" data-end="1184.539">但這個邪惡的生物非常狡猾，她終於想出了一個可以讓她得到想要的東西的計謀。她在廚房地板中間放了一根鐵條，然後通過她的魔法讓這根鐵條對人眼不可見。這樣，當桃樂絲走過地板時，她被鐵條絆倒，摔倒在地。她受傷不重，但在她摔倒時，一隻銀鞋掉了下來；在她伸手去拿之前，女巫已經搶走了它，穿在她自己瘦骨嶙峋的腳上。</p>
  
    <p data-start="1184.540" data-end="1195.280">The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how to do so.</p>
    <p data-start="1184.540" data-end="1195.280">這個邪惡的女人對她計謀的成功感到非常高興，因為只要她擁有一隻鞋，她就擁有了它們魅力的一半，桃樂絲即使知道如何使用它們，也無法對抗她。</p>
  
    <p data-start="1195.440" data-end="1205.040">The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, and said to the Witch, "Give me back my shoe!"</p>
    <p data-start="1195.440" data-end="1205.040">小女孩看到自己丟了一隻漂亮的鞋，生氣地對女巫說："把我的鞋還給我！"</p>
  
    <p data-start="1205.560" data-end="1210.840">"I will not," retorted the Witch, "for it is now my shoe, and not yours."</p>
    <p data-start="1205.560" data-end="1210.840">"我不會還的，"女巫反駁說，"因為它現在是我的鞋，不是你的了。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="1211.920" data-end="1217.020">"You are a wicked creature!" cried Dorothy. "You have no right to take my shoe from me."</p>
    <p data-start="1211.920" data-end="1217.020">"你真是個邪惡的生物！"桃樂絲喊道。"你沒有權利從我這裡拿走我的鞋子。"</p>
  
    <p data-start="1217.640" data-end="1247.600">"I shall keep it, just the same," said the Witch, laughing at her, "and someday I shall get the other one from you, too." This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot. Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away.</p>
    <p data-start="1217.640" data-end="1247.600">"我仍然會保留它，"女巫笑著說，"有一天我也會從你那裡得到另一隻。" 這讓桃樂絲非常生氣，她拿起附近的一桶水，猛地灑在女巫身上，把她從頭到腳都弄濕了。女巫立刻發出一聲驚恐的尖叫，然後當桃樂絲驚訝地看著她時，女巫開始縮小並溶解。</p>
  
    <p data-start="1248.100" data-end="1264.080">"See what you have done!" she screamed. "In a minute I shall melt away." "I'm very sorry, indeed," said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.</p>
    <p data-start="1248.100" data-end="1264.080">"看看你做了什麼！"她尖叫道。"我馬上就會融化了。" "我真的很抱歉，"桃樂絲說，她真的很害怕看到女巫真的像棕糖一樣在她眼前融化。</p>
  
    <p data-start="1265.240" data-end="1274.880">"Didn't you know water would be the end of me?" asked the Witch, in a wailing, despairing voice. "Of course not," answered Dorothy. "How should I?"</p>
    <p data-start="1265.240" data-end="1274.880">"你不知道水會是我的終結嗎？"女巫用一種哀號、絕望的聲音問。 "當然不知道，"桃樂絲回答。"我怎麼會知道呢？"</p>
  
    <p data-start="1275.320" data-end="1303.920">"Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds. Look out--here I go!"</p>
    <p data-start="1275.320" data-end="1303.920">"好吧，幾分鐘後我就會完全融化，你將擁有整個城堡。我曾經邪惡，但我從未想到像你這樣的小女孩竟然能融化我，結束我的邪惡行為。小心——我來了！"</p>
  
    <p data-start="1305.280" data-end="1352.380">With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange land.</p>
    <p data-start="1305.280" data-end="1352.380">說完這些話，女巫倒在了地上，化為棕色的融化無形的塊，開始擴散到廚房地板的乾淨木板上。看到她真的融化成了什麼都沒有，桃樂絲再拿起一桶水，將其灑在那堆爛泥上。然後她把它們全都掃出了門外。在撿出那隻銀鞋——老女人留下的唯一東西之後，她用布擦乾並清理了它，然後再次穿上。最後，她終於可以自由行動，她跑到院子裡告訴獅子，西方的邪惡女巫已經結束了，他們不再是陌生土地上的囚徒了。</p>
