    <p data-start="13" data-end="14.99999999" style="margin-left: 35%;">第 7 章：偉大的奧茲國之旅</p>
    
    <p data-start="15" data-end="20.99999999">They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near.</p>
    <p data-start="15" data-end="20.99999999">當晚他們必須在森林裡的一棵大樹下露營，因為附近沒有房子。</p>
    
    <p data-start="21" data-end="34.99999999">The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely.</p>
    <p data-start="21" data-end="34.99999999">這棵樹形成了一層厚厚的覆蓋物，可以保護它們免受露水的侵害，鐵皮樵夫用斧頭砍伐了一大堆木頭，桃樂絲建造了一座輝煌的火堆，溫暖了她，使她感到不那麼孤單。</p>
    
    <p data-start="35" data-end="40.99999999">She and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.</p>
    <p data-start="35" data-end="40.99999999">她和托托吃了最後的麵包，現在她不知道他們早餐該吃什麼。</p>
    
    <p data-start="41" data-end="46.99999999">"If you wish," said the Lion, "I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you.</p>
    <p data-start="41" data-end="46.99999999">"如果你願意," 獅子說, "我可以進森林裡為你殺一頭鹿。</p>
    
    <p data-start="47" data-end="54.99999999">You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast."</p>
    <p data-start="47" data-end="54.99999999">你可以在火邊烤它，因為你的口味如此特殊，喜歡熟食，這樣你就會有一頓非常豐盛的早餐。"</p>
    
    <p data-start="55" data-end="57.99999999">"Don't! Please don't," begged the Tin Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="55" data-end="57.99999999">"不要! 請不要," 鐵皮樵夫懇求道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="58" data-end="63.99999999">"I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again."</p>
    <p data-start="58" data-end="63.99999999">"如果你殺了一頭可憐的鹿，我肯定會哭，然後我的下巴又會生銹。"</p>
    
    <p data-start="64" data-end="71.99999999">But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it.</p>
    <p data-start="64" data-end="71.99999999">但是獅子走進了森林，找到了自己的晚餐，沒有人知道那是什麼，因為他從未提過。</p>
    
    <p data-start="72" data-end="80.99999999">And the Scarecrow found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time.</p>
    <p data-start="72" data-end="80.99999999">而稻草人找到了一棵滿是堅果的樹，並把桃樂絲的籃子裝滿，這樣她就不會餓很久了。</p>
    
    <p data-start="81" data-end="90.99999999">She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts.</p>
    <p data-start="81" data-end="90.99999999">她覺得這是稻草人的一片好心和體貼，但她大笑著看著這可憐的傢伙笨拙地撿起堅果。</p>
        
    <p data-start="91" data-end="98.99999999">His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket.</p>
    <p data-start="91" data-end="98.99999999">他的墊手如此笨拙，而堅果又這麼小，以至於他掉下的幾乎和他放進籃子裡的一樣多。</p>

    <p data-start="99" data-end="111.99999999">But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up.</p>
    <p data-start="99" data-end="111.99999999">但是稻草人並不介意裝滿籃子花了多長時間，因為這使他能遠離火焰，因為他擔心火星會落在他的稻草上把他燒掉。</p>

    <p data-start="112" data-end="120.99999999">So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.</p>
    <p data-start="112" data-end="120.99999999">所以他與火焰保持了很好的距離，只有在桃樂絲躺下睡覺時才靠近，用乾葉子蓋住她。</p>

    <p data-start="121" data-end="126.99999999">These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.</p>
    <p data-start="121" data-end="126.99999999">這些葉子使她非常舒適和溫暖，她一直睡到早晨。</p>

    <p data-start="127" data-end="135.99999999">When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.</p>
    <p data-start="127" data-end="135.99999999">天亮時，女孩在一條波光粼粼的小溪裡洗了臉，不久後他們都出發前往翡翠城。</p>

    <p data-start="136" data-end="139.99999999">This was to be an eventful day for the travelers.</p>
    <p data-start="136" data-end="139.99999999">對於旅行者來說，這將是充滿事件的一天。</p>

    <p data-start="140" data-end="150.99999999">They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side.</p>
    <p data-start="140" data-end="150.99999999">他們才走了一個小時，就看到前面有一條大壕溝橫穿道路，分割了兩邊的森林。</p>

    <p data-start="151" data-end="162.99999999">It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom.</p>
    <p data-start="151" data-end="162.99999999">這是一條非常寬的壕溝，當他們爬到邊緣往下看時，可以看到它也非常深，底部有很多大而鋸齒狀的岩石。</p>

    <p data-start="163" data-end="170.99999999">The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end.</p>
    <p data-start="163" data-end="170.99999999">兩邊非常陡峭，沒有人能夠爬下去，有那麼一刻，他們的旅程似乎要結束了。</p>

    <p data-start="171" data-end="174.99999999">"What shall we do?" asked Dorothy despairingly.</p>
    <p data-start="171" data-end="174.99999999">"我們該怎麼辦？" 桃樂絲絕望地問。</p>

    <p data-start="175" data-end="182.99999999">"I haven't the faintest idea," said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.</p>
    <p data-start="175" data-end="182.99999999">"我一點主意都沒有," 鐵皮樵夫說道，獅子搖了搖他那毛茸茸的鬃毛，若有所思地看著。</p>

    <p data-start="183" data-end="187.99999999">But the Scarecrow said, "We cannot fly, that is certain.</p>
    <p data-start="183" data-end="187.99999999">但是稻草人說，"我們不能飛，這是肯定的。</p>
        
    <p data-start="188" data-end="189.99999999">Neither can we climb down into this great ditch.</p>
    <p data-start="188" data-end="189.99999999">我們也不能爬下這條大壕溝。</p>
    
    <p data-start="190" data-end="194.99999999">Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where we are."</p>
    <p data-start="190" data-end="194.99999999">所以，如果我們不能跳過去，我們就得停在這裡。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="195" data-end="201.99999999">"I think I could jump over it," said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring the distance carefully in his mind.</p>
    <p data-start="195" data-end="201.99999999">“我想我可以跳過去，”膽小的獅子在心中仔細測量了距離後說道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="202" data-end="209.99999999">"Then we are all right," answered the Scarecrow, "for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time."</p>
    <p data-start="202" data-end="209.99999999">“那我們就沒事了，”稻草人回答道，“因為你可以一次把我們一個一個背過去。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="210" data-end="213.99999999">"Well, I'll try it," said the Lion. "Who will go first?"</p>
    <p data-start="210" data-end="213.99999999">“好吧，我會試試，”獅子說。“誰先去？”</p>
    
    <p data-start="214" data-end="224.99999999">"I will," declared the Scarecrow, "for, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below.</p>
    <p data-start="214" data-end="224.99999999">“我先去，”稻草人宣佈道，“因為，如果你發現你不能跳過這個深谷，桃樂絲會被殺死，或者鐵皮樵夫會被下面的岩石嚴重凹陷。</p>
    
    <p data-start="225" data-end="230.99999999">But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all."</p>
    <p data-start="225" data-end="230.99999999">但如果我在你背上，這就不那麼重要了，因為摔下來對我根本沒有傷害。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="231" data-end="238.99999999">"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself," said the Cowardly Lion, "but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it.</p>
    <p data-start="231" data-end="238.99999999">“我自己非常害怕掉下去，”膽小的獅子說，“但我想除了嘗試，別無他法。</p>
    
    <p data-start="239" data-end="242.99999999">So get on my back and we will make the attempt."</p>
    <p data-start="239" data-end="242.99999999">所以爬到我背上，我們會嘗試一下。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="243" data-end="250.99999999">The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down.</p>
    <p data-start="243" data-end="250.99999999">稻草人坐在獅子的背上，那隻大野獸走到深谷邊緣蹲下。</p>
    
    <p data-start="251" data-end="253.99999999">"Why don't you run and jump?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="251" data-end="253.99999999">“你為什麼不跑著跳呢？”稻草人問道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="254" data-end="257.99999999">"Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things," he replied.</p>
    <p data-start="254" data-end="257.99999999">“因為我們獅子不是這樣做的，”他回答道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="258" data-end="264.99999999">Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side.</p>
    <p data-start="258" data-end="264.99999999">然後他大力一跳，飛過空中，安全地落在另一邊。</p>
    
    <p data-start="265" data-end="275.99999999">They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again.</p>
    <p data-start="265" data-end="275.99999999">看到他這麼輕鬆地做到，他們都非常高興，稻草人從他背上下來後，獅子又跳過了壕溝。</p>
    
    <p data-start="276" data-end="285.99999999">Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.</p>
    <p data-start="276" data-end="285.99999999">桃樂絲認為她應該接著去；於是她把托托抱在懷裡，爬上獅子的背，一隻手緊緊抓住他的鬃毛。</p>
    
    <p data-start="286" data-end="294.99999999">The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other side.</p>
    <p data-start="286" data-end="294.99999999">下一刻，她似乎在空中飛翔；然後，還沒等她來得及想清楚，她已經安全地到了另一邊。</p>
    
    <p data-start="295" data-end="311.99999999">The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.</p>
    <p data-start="295" data-end="311.99999999">獅子第三次回去接鐵皮樵夫，然後他們都坐下來休息了一會兒，讓這隻野獸有機會休息，因為他的大跳讓他的呼吸變短，他像跑得太久的大狗一樣喘著氣。</p>
    
    <p data-start="312" data-end="316.99999999">They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy.</p>
    <p data-start="312" data-end="316.99999999">他們發現這邊的森林非常茂密，看起來又黑又陰沉。</p>
    
    <p data-start="317" data-end="330.99999999">After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again.</p>
    <p data-start="317" data-end="330.99999999">獅子休息後，他們沿著黃磚路出發了，心裡默默地想著，不知道他們是否能走到林子的盡頭，再次迎來明媚的陽光。</p>
    
    <p data-start="331" data-end="343.99999999">To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.</p>
    <p data-start="331" data-end="343.99999999">更讓他們不安的是，他們很快聽到了森林深處的奇怪聲音，獅子低聲告訴他們，卡利達斯就住在這個地方。</p>
    
    <p data-start="344" data-end="347.99999999">"What are the Kalidahs?" asked the girl.</p>
    <p data-start="344" data-end="347.99999999">“什麼是卡利達斯？”女孩問道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="348" data-end="361.99999999">"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers," replied the Lion, "and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto.</p>
    <p data-start="348" data-end="361.99999999">“它們是身體像熊，頭像老虎的巨大野獸，”獅子回答道，“它們的爪子又長又鋒利，可以像我殺死托托一樣輕易地把我撕成兩半。</p>
    
    <p data-start="362" data-end="365.99999999">I'm terribly afraid of the Kalidahs."</p>
    <p data-start="362" data-end="365.99999999">我非常害怕卡利達斯。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="366" data-end="371.99999999">"I'm not surprised that you are," returned Dorothy. "They must be dreadful beasts."</p>
    <p data-start="366" data-end="371.99999999">“我並不驚訝，”桃樂絲回答道。“它們一定是可怕的野獸。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="372" data-end="378.99999999">The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road.</p>
    <p data-start="372" data-end="378.99999999">獅子正要回答，突然他們來到另一條橫跨道路的深谷。</p>
    
    <p data-start="379" data-end="384.99999999">But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not leap across it.</p>
    <p data-start="379" data-end="384.99999999">但這一次谷太寬太深，獅子立刻知道他無法跳過去。</p>
    
    <p data-start="385" data-end="391.99999999">So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the Scarecrow said:</p>
    <p data-start="385" data-end="391.99999999">於是他們坐下來考慮該怎麼辦，經過認真思考後，稻草人說：</p>
    
    <p data-start="392" data-end="394.99999999">"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch.</p>
    <p data-start="392" data-end="394.99999999">“這裡有一棵大樹，緊靠壕溝站著。</p>
    
    <p data-start="395" data-end="402.99999999">If the Tin Woodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily."</p>
    <p data-start="395" data-end="402.99999999">如果鐵皮樵夫能把它砍倒，使它倒向另一邊，我們可以輕鬆地走過去。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="403" data-end="406.99999999">"That is a first-rate idea," said the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="403" data-end="406.99999999">“這是個一流的主意，”獅子說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="407" data-end="411.99999999">"One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw."</p>
    <p data-start="407" data-end="411.99999999">“人們幾乎會懷疑你的腦袋裡有腦子，而不是稻草。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="412" data-end="419.99999999">The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through.</p>
    <p data-start="412" data-end="419.99999999">樵夫馬上開始工作，他的斧頭非常鋒利，很快就把樹幾乎砍斷了。</p>
    
    <p data-start="420" data-end="434.99999999">Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.</p>
    <p data-start="420" data-end="434.99999999">然後獅子用強壯的前腿抵住樹，用盡全力推，慢慢地大樹傾斜，轟然倒在壕溝上，頂端的樹枝在另一邊。</p>
    
    <p data-start="435" data-end="451.99999999">They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.</p>
    <p data-start="435" data-end="451.99999999">他們剛開始過這座奇怪的橋，一聲尖銳的咆哮讓他們都抬起頭來，令他們恐懼的是，他們看到兩隻身體像熊，頭像老虎的大野獸向他們跑來。</p>
    
    <p data-start="452" data-end="457.99999999">"They are the Kalidahs!" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.</p>
    <p data-start="452" data-end="457.99999999">“他們是卡利達斯！”膽小的獅子開始顫抖。</p>
    
    <p data-start="458" data-end="459.99999999">"Quick!" cried the Scarecrow. "Let us cross over."</p>
    <p data-start="458" data-end="459.99999999">“快！”稻草人喊道。“讓我們過去。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="460" data-end="468.99999999">So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman followed, and the Scarecrow came next.</p>
    <p data-start="460" data-end="468.99999999">於是桃樂絲抱著托托先走，鐵皮樵夫跟隨，稻草人緊隨其後。</p>
    
    <p data-start="469" data-end="487.99999999">The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise.</p>
    <p data-start="469" data-end="487.99999999">獅子雖然確實害怕，但他轉身面對卡利達斯，然後他發出一聲如此響亮而可怕的吼叫，桃樂絲尖叫，稻草人向後倒下，而連兇猛的野獸也停了下來，驚訝地看著他。</p>
    
    <p data-start="488" data-end="501.99999999">But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next.</p>
    <p data-start="488" data-end="501.99999999">但看到他們比獅子大，並且記得有兩隻卡利達斯而只有一隻獅子，卡利達斯再次衝向前，獅子穿過樹，轉過身來看看他們接下來會怎麼做。</p>
    
    <p data-start="502" data-end="509.99999999">Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:</p>
    <p data-start="502" data-end="509.99999999">兇猛的野獸們也沒有停頓一下，開始過樹。獅子對桃樂絲說：</p>
    
    <p data-start="510" data-end="514.99999999">"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws.</p>
    <p data-start="510" data-end="514.99999999">“我們完了，因為他們肯定會用他們的鋒利爪子把我們撕成碎片。</p>
    
    <p data-start="515" data-end="519.99999999">But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am alive."</p>
    <p data-start="515" data-end="519.99999999">但站在我身後，只要我活著，我就會和他們戰鬥。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="520" data-end="522.99999999">"Wait a minute!" called the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="520" data-end="522.99999999">“等一下！”稻草人喊道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="523" data-end="530.99999999">He had been thinking what was best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch.</p>
    <p data-start="523" data-end="530.99999999">他一直在想最好的辦法，現在他讓樵夫砍掉樹在他們這邊壕溝的那端。</p>
    
    <p data-start="531" data-end="550.99999999">The Tin Woodman began to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom.</p>
    <p data-start="531" data-end="550.99999999">鐵皮樵夫立刻開始使用他的斧頭，正當兩隻卡利達斯快要過去時，樹轟然倒入深谷，把那些醜陋的，咆哮的畜生一起帶下去，兩隻都在底部的尖石上摔得粉碎。</p>
    
    <p data-start="551" data-end="565.99999999">"Well," said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, "I see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive.</p>
    <p data-start="551" data-end="565.99999999">“好吧，”膽小的獅子長長地舒了一口氣說，“我看到我們還能再活一會兒，我很高興，因為不活著一定是件很不舒服的事。</p>
    
    <p data-start="566" data-end="570.99999999">Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet."</p>
    <p data-start="566" data-end="570.99999999">那些生物把我嚇得不輕，我的心還在跳動。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="571" data-end="575.99999999">"Ah," said the Tin Woodman sadly, "I wish I had a heart to beat."</p>
    <p data-start="571" data-end="575.99999999">“啊，”鐵皮樵夫悲傷地說，“我希望我有一顆會跳動的心。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="576" data-end="587.99999999">This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had to ride on the Lion's back.</p>
    <p data-start="576" data-end="587.99999999">這次冒險讓旅行者們比以往任何時候都更急切地想離開森林，他們走得很快，桃樂絲累了，不得不騎在獅子的背上。</p>
    
    <p data-start="588" data-end="599.99999999">To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them.</p>
    <p data-start="588" data-end="599.99999999">令他們非常高興的是，隨著他們越走越遠，樹木變得越來越稀疏，下午他們突然來到一條寬闊的河流前，河水在他們面前迅速流淌。</p>
    
    <p data-start="600" data-end="613.99999999">On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits.</p>
    <p data-start="600" data-end="613.99999999">在水的另一邊，他們可以看到黃磚路穿過一個美麗的國家，綠色的草地上點綴著鮮花，路的兩邊是掛滿美味水果的樹木。</p>
    
    <p data-start="614" data-end="618.99999999">They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.</p>
    <p data-start="614" data-end="618.99999999">看到眼前這個令人愉快的國家，他們非常高興。</p>
    
    <p data-start="619" data-end="621.99999999">"How shall we cross the river?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="619" data-end="621.99999999">“我們怎樣過河？”桃樂絲問道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="622" data-end="624.99999999">"That is easily done," replied the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="622" data-end="624.99999999">“這很容易做到，”稻草人回答。</p>
    
    <p data-start="625" data-end="630.99999999">"The Tin Woodman must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side."</p>
    <p data-start="625" data-end="630.99999999">“鐵皮樵夫必須給我們建一個木筏，這樣我們就能漂到另一邊。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="631" data-end="642.99999999">So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit.</p>
    <p data-start="631" data-end="642.99999999">於是樵夫拿起斧頭開始砍伐小樹來製作木筏，當他忙於此事時，稻草人在河岸邊找到一棵結滿優質水果的樹。</p>
    
    <p data-start="643" data-end="649.99999999">This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.</p>
    <p data-start="643" data-end="649.99999999">這讓桃樂絲很高興，她整天只吃了堅果，現在她美美地吃了一頓熟水果。</p>
    
    <p data-start="650" data-end="661.99999999">But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.</p>
    <p data-start="650" data-end="661.99999999">但即使像鐵皮樵夫這樣勤奮不懈地製作木筏也需要時間，到了晚上工作還沒有完成。</p>
    
    <p data-start="662" data-end="677.99999999">So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.</p>
    <p data-start="662" data-end="677.99999999">於是他們在樹下找到一個舒適的地方，一直睡到早晨；桃樂絲夢見了翡翠城，夢見了善良的奧茲巫師，不久他將送她回到自己的家。</p>
