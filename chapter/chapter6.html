    <p data-start="13" data-end="14.99999999" style="margin-left: 35%;">第六章: 膽小的獅子</p>
    <p data-start="15" data-end="29.99999999">All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good.</p>
    <p data-start="15" data-end="29.99999999">這段時間桃樂絲和她的同伴一直在茂密的樹林裡行走。 道路都是黃磚鋪成的，但上面佈滿了乾枯的樹枝和枯葉，行走起來並不好。</p>
    <p data-start="30" data-end="36.99999999">There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine.</p>
    <p data-start="30" data-end="36.99999999">這片森林裡很少有鳥類，因為鳥兒喜歡陽光充足的開闊地帶。</p>
    <p data-start="37" data-end="55.99999999">But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side, and did not even bark in return.</p>
    <p data-start="37" data-end="55.99999999">但時不時地，隱匿在樹林中的野獸發出低沉的咆哮聲。 這些聲音讓小女孩心跳加速，因為她不知道是什麼發出了這些聲音。 但托托知道，他走到桃樂絲身邊，甚至沒有吠叫回應。</p>
    <p data-start="56" data-end="61.99999999">"How long will it be," the child asked of the Tin Woodman, "before we are out of the forest?"</p>
    <p data-start="56" data-end="61.99999999">「我們還要多久才能離開森林呢？」孩子問鐵皮樵夫。</p>
    <p data-start="62" data-end="80.99999999">"I cannot tell," was the answer, "for I have never been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful.</p>
    <p data-start="62" data-end="80.99999999">「我不知道，」回答說，「因為我從來沒有去過翡翠城。但是當我還是個孩子的時候，我的父親去過那裡一次，他說這是一次穿越危險國家的長途旅行，但是靠近奧茲居住城市的地方卻很美麗。</p>
    <p data-start="81" data-end="93.99999999">But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that will protect you from harm."</p>
    <p data-start="81" data-end="93.99999999">但只要我有油罐，我就不會害怕，沒有什麼能傷害稻草人，而你的額頭上有好女巫之吻的印記，這會保護你免受傷害。”</p>
    <p data-start="94" data-end="103.99999999">"But Toto!" said the girl anxiously. "What will protect him?""We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger," replied the Tin Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="94" data-end="103.99999999">「但是托托！」 女孩焦急地說。 「什麼能保護他？」 「如果他遇到危險，我們必須親自保護他。」鐵皮樵夫回答。</p>
    <p data-start="104" data-end="112.99999999">Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Lion bounded into the road.</p>
    <p data-start="104" data-end="112.99999999">正當他說話的時候，森林裡傳來一聲可怕的吼叫，下一瞬間，一頭巨大的獅子跳到了路上。</p>
    <p data-start="113" data-end="123.99999999">With one blow of his paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws.</p>
    <p data-start="113" data-end="123.99999999">他一爪子就把稻草人打得翻滾到了路邊，然後用鋒利的爪子攻擊了鐵皮樵夫。</p>
    <p data-start="124" data-end="130.99999999">But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.</p>
    <p data-start="124" data-end="130.99999999">但是，令獅子驚訝的是，儘管樵夫倒在路上並一動不動，但他卻無法在錫罐上留下任何印記。</p>
    <p data-start="131" data-end="151.99999999">Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:</p>
    <p data-start="131" data-end="151.99999999">「現在小托托有了一個敵人要面對，他狂吠著向著獅子衝去，而這隻巨獸已經打開嘴要咬狗了，但桃樂絲擔心托托會被殺死，毫不顧慮危險，衝上前去，狠狠地拍打獅子的鼻子，同時大聲喊道：」</p>
    <p data-start="152" data-end="158.99999999">"Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!"</p>
    <p data-start="152" data-end="158.99999999">「你敢咬托托嗎？你這樣的大畜生，竟然咬一隻可憐的小狗，你應該感到羞恥！”</p>
    <p data-start="159" data-end="164.99999999">"I didn't bite him," said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Dorothy had hit it.</p>
    <p data-start="159" data-end="164.99999999">「我沒有咬著他，」獅子一邊說，一邊用爪子揉著被桃樂絲拍打過的鼻子。</p>
    <p data-start="165" data-end="177.99999999">"No, but you tried to," she retorted. "You are nothing but a big coward.""I know it," said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. "I've always known it. But how can I help it?"</p>
    <p data-start="165" data-end="177.99999999">「是，但你試圖咬他，」她反駁道。 「你只不過是個膽小鬼。」 「我知道，」獅子羞愧地低下了頭。 「我一直都知道這一點。但我又能怎樣呢？」</p>
    <p data-start="178" data-end="194.99999999">"I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like the poor Scarecrow!""Is he stuffed?" asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shape again.</p>
    <p data-start="178" data-end="194.99999999">「我無法理解你，但我確定你就是個膽小鬼。想到你去攻擊那個可憐的填充的稻草人，真是讓人匪夷所思！」獅子驚訝地問道：「他是稻草填充的嗎？」獅子看著桃樂絲把稻草人抱起來，讓他站起來，然後再次把他恢復成原來的形狀。</p>
    <p data-start="195" data-end="207.99999999">"Of course he's stuffed," replied Dorothy, who was still angry."That's why he went over so easily," remarked the Lion. "It astonished me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?"</p>
    <p data-start="195" data-end="207.99999999">「當然他是填充的，」桃樂絲回答道，她還在生氣。「這就是他為什麼倒下得這麼容易，」獅子評論道。「看到他這樣旋轉我就感覺很驚訝。那另一個也是填充的嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="208" data-end="213.99999999">"No," said Dorothy, "he's made of tin." And she helped the Woodman up again.</p>
    <p data-start="208" data-end="213.99999999">“不，”桃樂絲說，“他是錫做的。” 她又去把樵夫扶了起來。</p>
    <p data-start="214" data-end="226.99999999">"That's why he nearly blunted my claws," said the Lion. "When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What is that little animal you are so tender of?"</p>
    <p data-start="214" data-end="226.99999999">「這就是為什麼他差點弄鈍了我的爪子。」獅子說。 「當爪子抓到錫鐵表面時，我的背脊一陣發涼。你那個如此溫柔的小動物是什麼？」</p>
    <p data-start="227" data-end="237.99999999">"He is my dog, Toto," answered Dorothy."Is he made of tin, or stuffed?" asked the Lion. "Neither. He's a--a--a meat dog," said the girl.</p>
    <p data-start="227" data-end="237.99999999">「他是我的狗，托托，」桃樂絲回答，「他是錫做的，還是其他物品填充的？」 獅子問。 「都不是。他是一隻——一隻——一隻肉狗，」女孩說。</p>
    <p data-start="238" data-end="251.99999999">"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me," continued the Lion sadly.</p>
    <p data-start="238" data-end="251.99999999">「喔！他是一種奇怪的動物，現在我看著他，看起來非常小。除了像我這樣的膽小鬼，沒有人會想到咬這麼小的東西，」獅子悲傷地繼續說道。</p>
    <p data-start="252" data-end="259.99999999">"What makes you a coward?" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.</p>
    <p data-start="252" data-end="259.99999999">「是什麼讓你成為一個膽小鬼？」桃樂絲問道，她驚訝地看著這頭巨獸，因為它像一匹小馬一樣大。</p>
    <p data-start="260" data-end="279.99999999">"It's a mystery," replied the Lion. "I suppose I was born that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way.</p>
    <p data-start="260" data-end="279.99999999">「這是一個謎。」獅子回答。 「我想我生來就是這樣。森林裡的所有其他動物自然都希望我勇敢，因為獅子到處都被認為是百獸之王。我了解到，如果我大聲咆哮，所有生物都會受到驚嚇，然後讓開。</p>
    <p data-start="280" data-end="304.99999999">Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself--I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go."</p>
    <p data-start="280" data-end="304.99999999">每當遇到人時，我都會非常害怕； 但我只要對他咆哮，他就會以最快的速度逃跑。 如果大象、老虎和熊試圖與我搏鬥，我就會逃跑──我確實是個膽小鬼； 但他們一聽到我的吼聲，就會逃離我，當然，我會讓他們離開。」</p>
    <p data-start="305" data-end="310.99999999">"But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="305" data-end="310.99999999">「但這是不對的，百獸之王不應該是個膽小鬼。」稻草人說道。</p>
    <p data-start="311" data-end="324.99999999">"I know it," returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. "It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy. But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast."</p>
    <p data-start="311" data-end="324.99999999">「我知道，」獅子回答道，用尾巴尖擦掉眼角的淚水。 “這是我的巨大悲傷，讓我的生活非常不快樂。但每當有危險時，我的心跳就開始加快。”</p>
    <p data-start="325" data-end="330.99999999">"Perhaps you have heart disease," said the Tin Woodman."It may be," said the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="325" data-end="330.99999999">「也許你有心臟病，」鐵皮樵夫說。「也許是吧，」獅子說。</p>
    <p data-start="331" data-end="341.99999999">"If you have," continued the Tin Woodman, "you ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart disease."</p>
    <p data-start="331" data-end="341.99999999">“如果你有，”鐵皮樵夫繼續說道，“你應該感到高興，因為這證明你有一顆心。而我呢，我沒有心，所以我不可能得心臟病。”</p>
    <p data-start="342" data-end="351.99999999">"Perhaps," said the Lion thoughtfully, "if I had no heart I should not be a coward.""Have you brains?" asked the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="342" data-end="351.99999999">「也許，」獅子若有所思地說，「如果我沒有心，我就不會成為一個膽小鬼。」「你有腦子嗎？」稻草人問。</p>
    <p data-start="352" data-end="362.99999999">"I suppose so. I've never looked to see," replied the Lion."I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some," remarked the Scarecrow, "for my head is stuffed with straw."</p>
    <p data-start="352" data-end="362.99999999">「我想是的。我從來沒有看過，」獅子回答道。「我要去偉大的奧茲那裡請他給我一個大腦，」稻草人說，「因為我的頭塞滿了稻草。」</p>
    <p data-start="363" data-end="371.99999999">"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart," said the Woodman."And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas," added Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="363" data-end="371.99999999">「我要請他給我一顆心，」樵夫說。「我要請他把托托和我送回堪薩斯州，」桃樂絲補充道。</p>
    <p data-start="372" data-end="380.99999999">"Do you think Oz could give me courage?" asked the Cowardly Lion. "Just as easily as he could give me brains," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="372" data-end="380.99999999">「你覺得奧茲能給我勇氣嗎？」 膽小的獅子問。 「就像他給我大腦一樣容易，」稻草人說。</p>
    <p data-start="381" data-end="386.99999999">"Or give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman."Or send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="381" data-end="386.99999999">「給我一顆心一樣容易，」鐵皮樵夫說。「送我回堪薩斯一樣容易，」桃樂絲說。</p>
    <p data-start="387" data-end="395.99999999">"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you," said the Lion, "for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage."</p>
    <p data-start="387" data-end="395.99999999">「那麼，如果你不介意的話，我就和你一起去，」獅子說道，「因為沒有一點勇氣，我的生活簡直難以忍受。」</p>
    <p data-start="396" data-end="408.99999999">"You will be very welcome," answered Dorothy, "for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily."</p>
    <p data-start="396" data-end="408.99999999">「我們非常歡迎你，」桃樂絲回答道，「因為你會幫助趕走其他野獸。在我看來，如果他們允許你如此輕易地嚇到他們，他們一定比你膽小。」</p>
    <p data-start="409" data-end="420.99999999">"They really are," said the Lion, "but that doesn't make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy."</p>
    <p data-start="409" data-end="420.99999999">「確實如此，」獅子說，「但這並不能讓我變得更勇敢，只要我知道自己是個膽小鬼，我就會不高興。」</p>
    <p data-start="421" data-end="427.99999999">So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with stately strides at Dorothy's side.</p>
    <p data-start="421" data-end="427.99999999">於是，這一小群人再次踏上了旅程，獅子邁著莊嚴的步伐走在桃樂絲的身邊。</p>
    <p data-start="428" data-end="445.99999999">Toto did not approve of this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Lion's great jaws. But after a time he became more at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.</p>
    <p data-start="428" data-end="445.99999999">托託一開始並不接納這個新夥伴，因為他無法忘記自己差點被獅子的下巴壓碎。 但過了一段時間，他看開了許多，托托和膽怯的獅子很快就成了好朋友。</p>
    <p data-start="446" data-end="459.99999999">During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing.</p>
    <p data-start="446" data-end="459.99999999">那天剩下的時間裡，沒有其他事情破壞他們旅途的平靜。 但有一次，鐵皮樵夫踩到了一隻沿著路爬行的甲蟲，殺死了這個可憐的小東西。</p>
    <p data-start="460" data-end="472.99999999">This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret.</p>
    <p data-start="460" data-end="472.99999999">這讓鐵皮樵夫很不高興，因為他總是小心翼翼地不傷害任何生物。 他一邊走一邊流下了幾滴悲傷和悔恨的淚水。</p>
    <p data-start="473" data-end="488.99999999">These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together.</p>
    <p data-start="473" data-end="488.99999999">這些淚水慢慢地順著他的臉流下來，流過下巴的鉸鏈，在那裡生鏽了。 當桃樂絲問他一個問題時，鐵皮樵夫張不開嘴，因為他的下巴緊緊地生鏽了。</p>
    <p data-start="489" data-end="499.99999999">He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong.</p>
    <p data-start="489" data-end="499.99999999">他對此感到非常害怕，多次向桃樂絲示意要幫他，但她無法理解。 獅子也很疑惑，不知道出了什麼問題。</p>
    <p data-start="500" data-end="508.99999999">But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's basket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.</p>
    <p data-start="500" data-end="508.99999999">但稻草人從桃樂絲的籃子裡抓起油罐，給樵夫的下巴塗了油，過了一會兒，他就能像以前一樣說話了。</p>
    <p data-start="509" data-end="522.99999999">"This will serve me a lesson," said he, "to look where I step. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak."</p>
    <p data-start="509" data-end="522.99999999">「這會給我一個教訓，」他說，「要觀察我踩到的地方。因為如果我要是殺死另一隻蟲子或甲蟲，我肯定會再次哭泣，而哭泣會腐蝕我的下巴，使我無法說話。」</p>
    <p data-start="523" data-end="542.99999999">Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.</p>
    <p data-start="523" data-end="542.99999999">此後他走得很小心，眼睛盯著路，看到一隻小螞蟻辛苦地走過，他就跳踩過去，免得傷著它。 鐵皮樵夫很清楚自己沒有心，因此他非常小心，永遠不會對任何事情殘忍或不仁慈。</p>
    <p data-start="543" data-end="557.99999999">"You people with hearts," he said, "have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn't mind so much."</p>
    <p data-start="543" data-end="557.99999999">「你們這些有心的人，」他說，「可以用心來引導你們，就能避免做錯事；但我沒有心，所以我必須非常小心。當奧茲給我一顆心時，我自然不用像現在那麽小心了。”</p>
