    <p data-start="18.5" data-end="21.99999999" style="margin-left: 35%;">第一章： 龍捲風</p>
    <p data-start="22" data-end="29.99999999">Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry,
      who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. </p>
    <p data-start="22" data-end="29.99999999">桃樂絲跟亨利叔叔、愛姆嬸嬸一起住在堪薩斯的大草原上。 亨利叔叔是個農夫，愛姆嬸嬸則是他的太太。</p>
    <p data-start="30" data-end="35.99999999">Their house was
      small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. </p>
    <p data-start="30" data-end="35.99999999">他們的房子很小，建造房子的木材必須用馬車從好幾英里外運過來。</p>
    <p data-start="36" data-end="48.99999999">There
      were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room
      contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three
      or four chairs, and the beds. </p>
    <p data-start="36" data-end="48.99999999">屋子是用四面牆壁和地板、天花板圍成一個房間，屋裡放了一座有些生鏽的爐子、一個裝碗盤的櫥櫃、一張桌子、三四張椅子，還有兩張床。</p>
    <p data-start="49" data-end="55.99999999">Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one
      corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. </p>
    <p data-start="49" data-end="55.99999999">亨利叔叔跟愛姆嬸嬸的大床放在一個角落，桃樂絲的小床則放在另一個角落。</p>
    <p data-start="56" data-end="70.99999999">There was no garret at all,
      and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar,
      where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty
      enough to crush any building in its path. </p>
    <p data-start="56" data-end="70.99999999">屋裡沒有閣樓，也沒有地窖──除了地上挖的一個小洞，叫做龍捲風地窖，萬一颳起強得足以摧毀沿路任何建築物的大旋風時，全家人就可以躲到裡面去。</p>
    <p data-start="71" data-end="78.99999999">It was reached by a trap door in the
      middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole. </p>
    <p data-start="71" data-end="78.99999999">地板中間有一道活門， 從那裡沿著梯子走下去，就可以進入那個黑漆漆的小洞中。</p>
    <p data-start="79" data-end="86.99999999">When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing
      but the great gray prairie on every side.</p>
    <p data-start="79" data-end="86.99999999">站在門口張望時，四面八方除了灰色的大草原，桃樂絲什麼 也看不見。</p>
    <p data-start="87" data-end="94.99999999">Not a tree nor a house broke the broad
      sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. </p>
    <p data-start="87" data-end="94.99999999">不論哪個方向，都沒有任何樹或房子會遮擋住直達天際、寬廣而平坦的鄉間景致。</p>
    <p data-start="95" data-end="101.99999999">The
      sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running
      through it.</p>
    <p data-start="95" data-end="101.99999999">太陽將犁過的田地烤成了一大塊灰色，表面滿布小小的裂痕。</p>
    <p data-start="102" data-end="110.99999999">Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the
      long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.</p>
    <p data-start="102" data-end="110.99999999">就連草都不是綠色的，因為太陽把長葉片的頂端，烤成了到處都看得見的相同灰色。</p>
    <p data-start="111" data-end="121.99999999">Once
      the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains
      washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.</p>
    <p data-start="111" data-end="121.99999999">他們住的房子曾經刷過油漆，可是太陽把油漆烤得裂了開來，雨水又將油漆沖刷掉，現在房子和其他一切一樣是暗淡和灰色的。</p>
    <p data-start="122" data-end="129.99999999">When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun
      and
      wind had changed her, too. </p>
    <p data-start="122" data-end="129.99999999">愛姆嬸嬸剛搬來這裡住的時候，還是個年輕貌美的妻子，但太陽和風也讓她變了模樣:</p>
    <p data-start="130" data-end="139.99999999"> They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left
      them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they
      were gray also. </p>
    <p data-start="130" data-end="139.99999999">帶走了她眼中的光彩，只留下一雙冷淡的灰色瞳眸;也帶走了她臉頰跟雙唇上的紅潤，使得它們也成了灰色。</p>
    <p data-start="140" data-end="143.99999999">She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. </p>
    <p data-start="140" data-end="143.99999999">她又瘦又憔悴，現在再也沒有笑容了。</p>
    <p data-start="144" data-end="157.99999999">When Dorothy,
      who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the
      child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart
      whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears; </p>
    <p data-start="144" data-end="157.99999999">當孤兒桃樂絲第一次來到她身邊時，愛姆嬸嬸被孩子的笑聲嚇了一跳，每當桃樂絲快樂的聲音傳到她耳邊時，她就會尖叫，並把手放在心窩上。</p>
    <p data-start="158" data-end="163.99999999">and she still looked at the
      little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.</p>
    <p data-start="158" data-end="163.99999999">現在，她依然會以驚奇的目光看著這個小女孩，不懂她為什麼還找得到好笑的事情。</p>
    <p data-start="164" data-end="170.99999999">Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and
      did
      not know what joy was. </p>
    <p data-start="164" data-end="170.99999999">亨利叔叔從來都不笑。他從早到晚賣力工作，渾然不知什麼 叫做快樂。</p>
    <p data-start="171" data-end="179.99999999">He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough
      boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.</p>
    <p data-start="171" data-end="179.99999999">他也是一身灰，從長鬍子到粗靴子都是。他看起來嚴厲又鮮少說話。</p>
    <p data-start="180" data-end="186.99999999">It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray
      as
      her other surroundings. </p>
    <p data-start="180" data-end="186.99999999">把桃樂絲逗笑的是托托，他讓她不至於變得跟周遭事物一樣灰撲撲的。</p>
    <p data-start="187" data-end="198.99999999">Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long
      silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his
      funny, wee nose. </p>
    <p data-start="187" data-end="198.99999999">托托不是灰色的，他是一 隻小黑狗，有一身光滑的皮毛，逗趣的小鼻 子，還有一雙長在鼻子兩邊、閃爍著快樂神采的黑色小眼睛。</p>
    <p data-start="199" data-end="204.99999999">Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and
      loved him dearly.</p>
    <p data-start="199" data-end="204.99999999">托托整天都在玩，桃樂絲也會跟他玩，她非常地愛他。</p>
    <p data-start="205" data-end="214.99999999">Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep
      and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual.</p>
    <p data-start="205" data-end="214.99999999">然而，他們今天沒有在玩。亨利叔叔坐在門階上，焦慮地望著比平常更灰暗的天空。</p>
    <p data-start="215" data-end="222.99999999">Dorothy
      stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em
      was washing the dishes.</p>
    <p data-start="215" data-end="222.99999999">桃樂絲抱著托托站在門口，也同樣盯著天空看。愛姆嬸嬸正在洗碗。</p>
    <p data-start="223" data-end="243.99999999">From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry
      and
      Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming
      storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they
      turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that
      direction also.</p>
    <p data-start="223" data-end="243.99999999">
      他們聽見從遙遠北方傳來風的低鳴，亨利叔叔跟桃樂絲看見長長的草在即將來臨的風暴吹拂下，形成了一陣陣的波浪。這時候，南方傳來了尖銳的呼嘯聲。他們轉動眼睛，看見那個方向的 草上也起了陣陣漣漪。</p>
    <p data-start="244" data-end="245.99999999">Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.</p>
    <p data-start="244" data-end="245.99999999">亨利叔叔忽然站了起來。</p>
    <p data-start="246" data-end="254.99999999">"There's a cyclone coming, Em," he called to his wife. "I'll go look
      after the
      stock." Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.</p>
    <p data-start="246" data-end="254.99999999">
      「愛姆，有龍捲風要來了，」他對太太說。「我要去照顧那些牲畜。」然後他就往畜養乳牛跟馬的棚子跑去。</p>
    <p data-start="255" data-end="262.99999999">Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of
      the
      danger close at hand.</p>
    <p data-start="255" data-end="262.99999999">愛姆嬸嬸拋下手邊的工作，來到門邊。匆匆瞄了一眼，她就知道危險即將來臨。</p>
    <p data-start="263" data-end="265.99999999">"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed. "Run for the cellar!"</p>
    <p data-start="263" data-end="265.99999999">「快，桃樂絲!」她大叫。「快進地窖去!」</p>
    <p data-start="266" data-end="271.99999999">Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl
      started
      to get him. </p>
    <p data-start="266" data-end="271.99999999">托托從桃樂絲的懷裡跳出去，躲到了床底下，女孩開始要去抓他。</p>
    <p data-start="272" data-end="280.99999999">Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor
      and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole.</p>
    <p data-start="272" data-end="280.99999999">愛姆阿姨嚇壞了，她打開地板上的活門，順著梯子爬進那個又小又黑的洞裡。</p>
    <p data-start="281" data-end="285.99999999">Dorothy caught Toto at
      last and started to follow her aunt. </p>
    <p data-start="281" data-end="285.99999999">桃樂絲總算抓住了托托，要跟嬸嬸一樣爬下去。</p>
    <p data-start="286" data-end="297.99999999">When she was halfway across the room
      there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she
      lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.</p>
    <p data-start="286" data-end="297.99999999">當她穿過房間的一半時，風中傳來一陣巨大的尖叫聲，房子劇烈搖晃，她失去了重心，突然坐到了地板上。</p>
    <p data-start="298" data-end="299.99999999">Then a strange thing happened.</p>
    <p data-start="298" data-end="299.99999999">這時奇怪的事情發生了。</p>
    <p data-start="300" data-end="309.99999999">The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the
      air.
      Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.</p>
    <p data-start="300" data-end="309.99999999">房子旋轉了兩三圈，緩緩升到空中。 桃樂絲感覺自己好像在氣球裡上升。</p>
    <p data-start="310" data-end="316.99999999">The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the
      exact
      center of the cyclone. </p>
    <p data-start="310" data-end="316.99999999">北方與南方的風在屋子的所在地會合，形成了龍捲風的中
      心。</p>
    <p data-start="317" data-end="330.99999999">In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but
      the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher
      and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone;</p>
    <p data-start="317" data-end="330.99999999">在龍捲風的中心處，氣流大致上是靜止的，但來自四面八方的巨大壓力，卻把屋子抬得越升越高，直到抵達龍捲風的最上方。</p>
    <p data-start="331" data-end="337.99999999">and there it remained
      and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.</p>
    <p data-start="331" data-end="337.99999999">屋子就這麼待在那兒，並像一根羽毛一樣輕易地被龍捲風帶到數英里以外的地方。</p>
    <p data-start="338" data-end="346.99999999">It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy
      found
      she was riding quite easily. </p>
    <p data-start="338" data-end="346.99999999">屋裡黑漆漆的，狂風不停在她身旁呼號，但桃樂絲倒覺得乘坐得挺輕鬆愜意的。</p>
    <p data-start="347" data-end="356.99999999">After the first few whirls around, and one other
      time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently,
      like a baby in a cradle.</p>
    <p data-start="347" data-end="356.99999999">在最初的幾次旋轉之後，還有一次當房子嚴重傾斜時，她感覺自己好像被輕輕地搖晃著，就像搖籃裡的嬰兒一樣。</p>
    <p data-start="357" data-end="368.99999999">Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,
      barking
      loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would
      happen.</p>
    <p data-start="357" data-end="368.99999999">托託不喜歡這樣。 他在房間裡跑來跑去，時而這裡，時而那裡，大聲吠叫； 但桃樂絲一動不動地坐在地板上，等著看會發生什麼事。</p>
    <p data-start="369" data-end="377.99999999">Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the
      little girl
      thought she had lost him.</p>
    <p data-start="369" data-end="377.99999999">有一次，托托太靠近打開的活門，掉了進去； 起初，小女孩以為自己失去了它。</p>
    <p data-start="378" data-end="386.99999999">But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through
      the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could
      not fall. </p>
    <p data-start="378" data-end="386.99999999">但她很快就看見他的一隻耳朵伸出了洞
      口，因為強大的氣壓把托托往上頂，他才沒有掉下去。</p>
    <p data-start="387" data-end="397.99999999">She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the
      room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could
      happen.</p>
    <p data-start="387" data-end="397.99999999">她爬到洞口，抓住托托的耳朵把他拖回屋裡，然後關上活門，避免意外再度發生。</p>
    <p data-start="398" data-end="410.99999999">Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but
      she
      felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly
      became deaf.</p>
    <p data-start="398" data-end="410.99999999">一個小時又一個小時過去了，桃樂絲慢慢克服了恐懼，但她覺得很孤單，風聲不停在耳邊大聲呼嘯，震得她幾乎快聾了。</p>
    <p data-start="411" data-end="425.99999999">At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when
      the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she
      stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would
      bring. </p>
    <p data-start="411" data-end="425.99999999">一開始，她猜想房子墜下時，自己可能會摔得粉碎，但數小時過去，沒有發生任何可怕的事情，她也就不再擔心，決定要冷靜觀察後續發展。</p>
    <p data-start="426" data-end="434.99999999">At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down
      upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her. </p>
    <p data-start="426" data-end="434.99999999">最後，她爬過不斷晃動的地板，爬上了床躺著，托托也跟了過來，趴在她的身旁。</p>
    <p data-start="435" data-end="442.99999999">In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,
      Dorothy soon
      closed her eyes and fell fast asleep. </p>
    <p data-start="435" data-end="442.99999999">儘管房子不停晃動，風聲不停呼嘯，桃樂絲卻閉上眼睛，很快就睡著了。</p>
