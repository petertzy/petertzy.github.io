    <p data-start="11.50" data-end="12.62" style="margin-left: 35%;">Chapter 10: The Guardian of the Gates.</p>
    <p data-start="11.50" data-end="12.62" style="margin-left: 35%;">第十章：大門的守護者</p>

    <p data-start="12.62" data-end="33.34">It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.</p>
    <p data-start="12.62" data-end="33.34">過了一會兒膽小的獅子才醒過來，因為他在罌粟花中躺了很久，吸入了它們致命的芳香；但當他睜開眼睛，從卡車上滾下來時，發現自己還活著，他感到非常高興。</p>

    <p data-start="33.34" data-end="40.74">"I ran as fast as I could," he said, sitting down and yawning, "but the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?"</p>
    <p data-start="33.34" data-end="40.74">“我盡可能快地奔跑，”他坐下來打著哈欠說，“但那些花太強了。你們是怎麼把我救出來的？”</p>

    <p data-start="41.02" data-end="46.86">Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:</p>
    <p data-start="41.02" data-end="46.86">然後他們告訴他是田鼠們如何慷慨地將他從死亡中拯救出來的；膽小的獅子笑了，說：</p>

    <p data-start="47.96" data-end="64.68">"I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?"</p>
    <p data-start="47.96" data-end="64.68">“我一直以為自己非常巨大而可怕；然而如此微小的花卉差點殺了我，而如此小的動物如老鼠卻救了我的命。一切都太奇怪了！但是，夥伴們，我們現在該怎麼做？”</p>

    <p data-start="65.46" data-end="73.12">"We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again," said Dorothy, "and then we can keep on to the Emerald City."</p>
    <p data-start="65.46" data-end="73.12">“我們必須繼續旅行，直到再次找到黃磚路，”桃樂絲說，“然後我們可以繼續前往翡翠城。”</p>

    <p data-start="73.82" data-end="93.44">So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.</p>
    <p data-start="73.82" data-end="93.44">所以，獅子完全恢復了精神，感覺又回到了自己身上，他們全體開始了旅程，十分享受在柔軟新鮮的草地上行走；不久後，他們就達到了黃磚路，並轉向了大魔法師居住的翡翠城。</p>

    <p data-start="94.82" data-end="108.26">The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.</p>
    <p data-start="94.82" data-end="108.26">現在道路平滑而鋪設良好，周圍的風景也很美麗，因此旅行者們很高興能把森林拋在腦後，以及他們在陰暗的樹蔭中遇到的種種危險。</p>

    <p data-start="109.60" data-end="121.14">Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green.</p>
    <p data-start="109.60" data-end="121.14">他們再次看到路邊修建的圍欄，但這些圍欄都是綠色的，當他們來到一座小房子時，那也是綠色的，顯然那裡住著一位農夫。</p>

    <p data-start="121.74" data-end="138.92">They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid.</p>
    <p data-start="121.74" data-end="138.92">他們在下午經過了幾座這樣的房子，有時有人走到門口看著他們，好像想要問些問題；但因為膽小的獅子，他們沒有靠近也沒有與他們交談，因為他們非常害怕這隻大獅子。</p>

    <p data-start="139.66" data-end="147.48">The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins.</p>
    <p data-start="139.66" data-end="147.48">人們都穿著美麗的翡翠綠色衣服，戴著像芒奇金人一樣的尖帽子。</p>

    <p data-start="148.88" data-end="157.08">"This must be the Land of Oz," said Dorothy, "and we are surely getting near the Emerald City." "Yes," answered the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="148.88" data-end="157.08">“這一定是奧茲國，”桃樂絲說，“我們肯定快到翡翠城了。” “是的，”稻草人回答。</p>

    <p data-start="157.50" data-end="173.90">"Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night."</p>
    <p data-start="157.50" data-end="173.90">“這裡的一切都是綠色的，而門欄國的顏色是藍色的。但是這些人似乎不像芒奇金人那樣友好，我擔心我們可能找不到過夜的地方。”</p>

    <p data-start="173.94" data-end="180.60">"I should like something to eat besides fruit," said the girl, "and I'm sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people."</p>
    <p data-start="173.94" data-end="180.60">“我想吃些水果以外的食物，”女孩說，“而且我確定托托快餓死了。我們在下一座房子停下來，跟人們談談吧。”</p>

    <p data-start="180.60" data-end="187.04">So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked.</p>
    <p data-start="180.60" data-end="187.04">於是，當他們來到一座中等大小的農舍時，桃樂絲勇敢地走到門前敲了敲。</p>

    <p data-start="187.06" data-end="193.90">A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said,</p>
    <p data-start="187.06" data-end="193.90">一位女士把門打開了一條縫隙來看外面，然後說：</p>

    <p data-start="193.92" data-end="207.78">"What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?" "We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us," answered Dorothy; "and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world."</p>
    <p data-start="193.92" data-end="207.78">“孩子，你們想要什麼？為什麼那隻大獅子也和你們在一起？” “我們希望能在你們那裡過夜，如果你們願意，”桃樂絲回答說，“而且這隻獅子是我的朋友和夥伴，他不會傷害你們的。”</p>

    <p data-start="208.10" data-end="232.70">"Is he tame?" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider. "Oh, yes," said the girl, "and he is a great coward, too. He will be more afraid of you than you are of him." "Well," said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion, "if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep."</p>
    <p data-start="208.10" data-end="232.70">“他是馴化過的嗎？”女士問道，將門再打開一些。“哦，是的，”女孩說，“他也非常膽小。他會比你更怕你。” “嗯，”女士說，經過一番考慮，再次瞄了一眼獅子後，“既然如此，你們可以進來，我會給你們準備晚餐和一個睡覺的地方。”</p>

    <p data-start="232.70" data-end="251.40">So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:</p>
    <p data-start="232.70" data-end="251.40">於是他們全部進了房子，除了那位女士，還有兩個孩子和一位男子。那名男子傷了腿，正躺在角落的沙發上。他們似乎對這麼奇怪的隊伍感到驚訝，當女士忙著擺桌子時，那名男子問道：</p>

    <p data-start="251.70" data-end="258.12">"Where are you all going?" "To the Emerald City," said Dorothy, "to see the Great Oz."</p>
    <p data-start="251.70" data-end="258.12">“你們要去哪裡？” “去翡翠城，”桃樂絲說，“去見大魔法師。”</p>

    <p data-start="258.40" data-end="266.68">"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed the man. "Are you sure that Oz will see you?" "Why not?" she replied.</p>
    <p data-start="258.40" data-end="266.68">“哦，真的！”男子驚呼道。“你確定大魔法師會見你們嗎？” “為什麼不呢？”她回答。</p>

    <p data-start="267.68" data-end="288.84">"Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him."</p>
    <p data-start="267.68" data-end="288.84">“聽說他從不讓任何人見到他。我曾去過翡翠城很多次，那是一個美麗而奇妙的地方；但我從未被允許見過大魔法師，也不知道有誰見過他。”</p>

    <p data-start="288.94" data-end="304.20">"Does he never go out?" asked the Scarecrow. "Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face." "What is he like?" asked the girl.</p>
    <p data-start="288.94" data-end="304.20">“他從不出門嗎？”稻草人問。“從不。他日復一日地坐在他宮殿的大寶座室中，即使是那些伺候他的人也無法面對面地見到他。” “他是什麼樣的？”女孩問。</p>

    <p data-start="304.22" data-end="333.72">"That is hard to tell," said the man thoughtfully. "You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell."</p>
    <p data-start="304.22" data-end="333.72">“這很難說，”男子沉思道。“你看，奧茲是位大魔法師，他可以變成任何他想要的形狀。所以，有些人說他看起來像一隻鳥；有些人說他像一隻大象；還有些人說他像一隻貓。對其他人來說，他可能像一位美麗的仙女，或小精靈，或者任何他喜歡的形狀。但當他以自己的真正形狀出現時，沒有活著的人能說清楚。”</p>

    <p data-start="334.68" data-end="347.24">"That is very strange," said Dorothy, "but we must try, in some way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing." "Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?" asked the man.</p>
    <p data-start="334.68" data-end="347.24">“這真是非常奇怪，”桃樂絲說，“但我們必須設法見到他，不然我們的旅行就白費了。” “你們為什麼想見那可怕的大魔法師？”男子問。</p>

    <p data-start="348.28" data-end="357.20">"I want him to give me some brains," said the Scarecrow eagerly. "Oh, Oz could do that easily enough," declared the man. "He has more brains than he needs."</p>
    <p data-start="348.28" data-end="357.20">“我希望他能給我一個大腦，”稻草人急切地說。“哦，大魔法師可以輕易做到這一點，”男子說。“他有比他需要的更多的腦子。”</p>

    <p data-start="357.40" data-end="386.92">"And I want him to give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman. "That will not trouble him," continued the man, "for Oz has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes." "And I want him to give me courage," said the Cowardly Lion. "Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room," said the man, "which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over. He will be glad to give you some."</p>
    <p data-start="357.40" data-end="386.92">“我還希望他能給我一顆心，”鐵皮人說。“這不會困擾他，”男子繼續說，“因為大魔法師有大量各種尺寸和形狀的心。” “而我希望他能給我勇氣，”膽小的獅子說。“大魔法師在他的寶座室裡保留了一大鍋勇氣，”男子說，“他用一個金盤子蓋著，以防止溢出。他會很樂意給你一些。”</p>

    <p data-start="386.94" data-end="390.06">"And I want him to send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="386.94" data-end="390.06">“我還希望他能送我回到堪薩斯，”桃樂絲說。</p>

    <p data-start="390.80" data-end="393.56">"Where is Kansas?" asked the man, with surprise.</p>
    <p data-start="390.80" data-end="393.56">“堪薩斯在哪裡？”那男子驚訝地問道。</p>

    <p data-start="394.58" data-end="401.08">"I don't know," replied Dorothy sorrowfully, "but it is my home, and I'm sure it's somewhere."</p>
    <p data-start="394.58" data-end="401.08">“我不知道，”桃樂絲悲傷地回答，“但那是我的家，我相信它一定在某個地方。”</p>

    <p data-start="402.02" data-end="431.10">"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?" he continued, speaking to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.</p>
    <p data-start="402.02" data-end="431.10">“很可能。好吧，大魔法師無所不能；所以我想他會幫你找到堪薩斯。但首先你必須見到他，這將是一個艱難的任務；因為大魔法師不喜歡見任何人，他通常有自己的辦法。但是你們想要什麼呢？”他接著問道，轉向托托。托托只是搖了搖尾巴；奇怪的是，他無法說話。</p>

    <p data-start="431.10" data-end="459.84">The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal. The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.</p>
    <p data-start="431.10" data-end="459.84">女士現在告訴他們晚餐已經準備好了，所以他們圍坐在桌旁，桃樂絲吃了一些美味的粥、一盤炒蛋和一片美味的白麵包，享用了她的晚餐。獅子吃了一些粥，但不喜歡，說這是用燕麥做的，而燕麥是馬的食物，不是獅子的。稻草人和鐵皮人什麼也沒吃。托托吃了一點每樣東西，對再次得到一頓豐盛的晚餐感到高興。</p>

    <p data-start="459.90" data-end="480.34">The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.</p>
    <p data-start="459.90" data-end="480.34">女士現在給桃樂絲準備了一張床讓她睡覺，托托躺在她身邊，而獅子則守在她房間的門口，以免打擾她。稻草人和鐵皮人站在角落裡，整晚保持安靜，儘管他們當然無法入睡。</p>

    <p data-start="481.24" data-end="490.48">The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.</p>
    <p data-start="481.24" data-end="490.48">第二天早晨，太陽一升起，他們就啟程了，很快就看到前方天空中有一抹美麗的綠色光輝。</p>

    <p data-start="491.66" data-end="503.00">"That must be the Emerald City," said Dorothy. As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels.</p>
    <p data-start="491.66" data-end="503.00">“那一定是翡翠城，”桃樂絲說。當他們繼續前行時，綠色的光輝變得越來越亮，他們似乎終於接近了旅行的終點。</p>

    <p data-start="504.36" data-end="534.00">Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color. In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy. There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within.</p>
    <p data-start="504.36" data-end="534.00">然而，直到下午他們才來到圍繞城市的大牆。牆高大厚實，顏色明亮的綠色。在他們面前，黃磚路的盡頭是一扇大門，鑲滿了閃閃發光的綠寶石，在陽光下熠熠生輝，甚至連稻草人的畫眼也被這光輝所眩目。門旁有一個鈴鐺，桃樂絲按下按鈕，聽到裡面傳來銀鈴般的聲音。</p>

    <p data-start="535.78" data-end="548.34">Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.</p>
    <p data-start="535.78" data-end="548.34">然後，大門慢慢地打開了，他們都走了進去，發現自己身處一個高高拱形的房間，牆壁上閃爍著無數的綠寶石。</p>

    <p data-start="549.30" data-end="563.00">Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.</p>
    <p data-start="549.30" data-end="563.00">在他們面前站著一位小矮人，身材與門欄國人差不多。他全身穿著綠色的衣服，從頭到腳，甚至皮膚也有綠色的色調。他的旁邊擺放著一個大綠色的箱子。</p>

    <p data-start="565.04" data-end="573.94">When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, "What do you wish in the Emerald City?" "We came here to see the Great Oz," said Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="565.04" data-end="573.94">當他看到桃樂絲和她的夥伴們時，這位小矮人問道：“你們來翡翠城想要什麼？” “我們來這裡是為了見大魔法師，”桃樂絲說。</p>

    <p data-start="574.66" data-end="582.00">The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.</p>
    <p data-start="574.66" data-end="582.00">這位小矮人對這個回答感到非常驚訝，他坐下來仔細思考。</p>

    <p data-start="582.68" data-end="617.00">"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz," he said, shaking his head in perplexity. "He is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant." "But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one," replied the Scarecrow; "it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard." "So he is," said the green man, "and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face.</p>
    <p data-start="582.68" data-end="617.00">“已經很多年沒有人要求我帶他們去見大魔法師了，”他說，困惑地搖了搖頭。“他非常強大而可怕，如果你們來這裡是為了無聊或愚蠢的目的去打擾大魔法師的明智思考，他可能會生氣，瞬間毀滅你們所有人。” “但這不是無聊的事情，也不是空閒的，”稻草人回答，“這是重要的。我們聽說大魔法師是一位善良的魔法師。” “的確如此，”綠衣男子說，“他明智而善良地統治著翡翠城。但對於那些不誠實的，或出於好奇心來見他的人，他是非常可怕的，幾乎沒有人敢要求見他的面。”</p>

    <p data-start="617.76" data-end="641.00">I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the spectacles." "Why?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="617.76" data-end="641.00">“我是大門的守護者，你們要求見大魔法師，所以我必須帶你們去他的宮殿。但首先你們必須戴上眼鏡。” “為什麼？”桃樂絲問。</p>

    <p data-start="643.00" data-end="670.00">"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them." He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in them.</p>
    <p data-start="643.00" data-end="670.00">“因為如果你們不戴眼鏡，翡翠城的光輝和榮耀會使你們失明。即使是居住在城市的人也必須白天黑夜都戴上眼鏡。所有的眼鏡都被鎖住了，因為大魔法師在城市建造之初就這麼規定了，我是唯一能打開它們的鑰匙。”他打開了大箱子，桃樂絲看到裡面裝滿了各種尺寸和形狀的眼鏡。所有的眼鏡都帶有綠色的鏡片。</p>

    <p data-start="671.02" data-end="692.16">The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck.</p>
    <p data-start="671.02" data-end="692.16">守門人找到了一副剛好適合桃樂絲的眼鏡，把它們放在她的眼睛上。眼鏡上有兩條金色的帶子，繞過她的頭部後，在頭後被鎖住，鎖的鑰匙是掛在守門人脖子上的鏈條末端的。</p>

    <p data-start="693.62" data-end="722.84">When they were on, Dorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing. Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key. Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace.</p>
    <p data-start="693.62" data-end="722.84">當眼鏡戴上後，桃樂絲即使想要也無法取下來，但她當然不希望被翡翠城的耀眼光芒盲目，因此什麼也沒說。然後，綠衣男子為稻草人、鐵皮人、獅子，甚至小托托都配上了眼鏡，所有的眼鏡都用鑰匙鎖得牢牢的。接著，守門人戴上了自己的眼鏡，告訴他們他已經準備好帶他們去宮殿了。</p>

    <p data-start="723.86" data-end="735.34">Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.</p>
    <p data-start="723.86" data-end="735.34">他從牆上的鉤子上取下一把大金鑰匙，打開了另一扇門，他們都跟隨他穿過門廊，進入了翡翠城的街道。</p>
