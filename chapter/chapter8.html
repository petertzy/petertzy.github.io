    <p data-start="14" data-end="15.99999999" style="margin-left: 35%;">Chapter 8: The Deadly Poppy Field</p>
    <p data-start="14" data-end="15.99999999" style="margin-left: 35%;">第八章：致命的罌粟花田</p>
    
    <p data-start="16" data-end="27.99999999">Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river.</p>
    <p data-start="16" data-end="27.99999999">我們這小小的旅行團第二天早晨醒來時精神煥發，充滿希望。桃樂絲像公主一樣，以河邊樹上的桃子和李子為早餐。</p>
    
    <p data-start="28" data-end="34.99999999">Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many discouragements;</p>
    <p data-start="28" data-end="34.99999999">在他們身後是他們安全穿過的黑暗森林，雖然他們經歷了許多挫折；</p>
    
    <p data-start="35" data-end="40.99999999">but before them was a lovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.</p>
    <p data-start="35" data-end="40.99999999">但在他們面前是一片可愛的陽光明媚的國土，似乎在召喚他們前往翡翠城。</p>
    
    <p data-start="41" data-end="45.99999999">To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.</p>
    <p data-start="41" data-end="45.99999999">當然，寬闊的河流現在將他們與這片美麗的土地隔開。</p>
    
    <p data-start="46" data-end="55.99999999">But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start.</p>
    <p data-start="46" data-end="55.99999999">但是木筏快完成了，鐵皮樵夫又砍了幾根原木，並用木釘把它們固定在一起後，他們準備出發了。</p>
    
    <p data-start="56" data-end="61.99999999">Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms.</p>
    <p data-start="56" data-end="61.99999999">桃樂絲坐在木筏中間，抱著托托。</p>
    
    <p data-start="62" data-end="67.99999999">When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy;</p>
    <p data-start="62" data-end="67.99999999">當膽小獅子踏上木筏時，木筏嚴重傾斜，因為他又大又重；</p>
    
    <p data-start="68" data-end="77.99999999">but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.</p>
    <p data-start="68" data-end="77.99999999">但是稻草人和鐵皮樵夫站在另一端來穩定它，他們手裡拿著長桿，將木筏推過水面。</p>
    
    <p data-start="78" data-end="89.99999999">They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick.</p>
    <p data-start="78" data-end="89.99999999">起初他們進展得相當順利，但當他們到達河中間時，急流把木筏沖向下游，越來越遠離黃磚路。</p>
    
    <p data-start="90" data-end="93.99999999">And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom.</p>
    <p data-start="90" data-end="93.99999999">而且水變得很深，長桿無法觸及底部。</p>
    
    <p data-start="94" data-end="106.99999999">"This is bad," said the Tin Woodman, "for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West, and she will enchant us and make us her slaves."</p>
    <p data-start="94" data-end="106.99999999">“這很糟糕，”鐵皮樵夫說，“如果我們不能到達陸地，我們將被帶到西方邪惡女巫的國度，她會施法把我們變成她的奴隸。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="107" data-end="110.99999999">"And then I should get no brains," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="107" data-end="110.99999999">“那我就得不到腦子了，”稻草人說。</p>
        
    <p data-start="111" data-end="114.99999999">"And I should get no courage," said the Cowardly Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="111" data-end="114.99999999">“那我就得不到勇氣了，”膽小獅子說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="115" data-end="117.99999999">"And I should get no heart," said the Tin Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="115" data-end="117.99999999">“那我就得不到心了，”鐵皮樵夫說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="118" data-end="121.99999999">"And I should never get back to Kansas," said Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="118" data-end="121.99999999">“那我就永遠無法回到堪薩斯了，”桃樂絲說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="122" data-end="134.99999999">"We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can," the Scarecrow continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river.</p>
    <p data-start="122" data-end="134.99999999">“如果可以，我們一定要到翡翠城去，”稻草人繼續說道，他用力推他的長桿，結果桿子牢牢地卡在了河底的泥中。</p>
    
    <p data-start="135" data-end="144.99999999">Then, before he could pull it out again--or let go-- the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.</p>
    <p data-start="135" data-end="144.99999999">然後，在他能再次拔出或放手之前，木筏被沖走了，可憐的稻草人被留在河中間，緊緊抓住桿子。</p>
    
    <p data-start="145" data-end="149.99999999">"Good-bye!" he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave him.</p>
    <p data-start="145" data-end="149.99999999">“再見！”他對他們喊道，他們很遺憾要離開他。</p>
    
    <p data-start="150" data-end="158.99999999">Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.</p>
    <p data-start="150" data-end="158.99999999">事實上，鐵皮樵夫開始哭泣，但幸運的是他記得自己可能會生鏽，所以他用桃樂絲的圍裙擦乾了眼淚。</p>
    
    <p data-start="159" data-end="162.99999999">Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="159" data-end="162.99999999">當然，這對稻草人來說是件壞事。</p>
    
    <p data-start="163" data-end="167.99999999">"I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy," he thought.</p>
    <p data-start="163" data-end="167.99999999">“現在的情況比我剛遇到桃樂絲時更糟糕了，”他想。</p>
    
    <p data-start="168" data-end="173.99999999">"Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare the crows, at any rate.</p>
    <p data-start="168" data-end="173.99999999">“那時，我被困在玉米地的桿子上，無論如何，我還能假裝嚇唬烏鴉。</p>
    
    <p data-start="174" data-end="179.99999999">But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck on a pole in the middle of a river.</p>
    <p data-start="174" data-end="179.99999999">但毫無疑問，稻草人被困在河中央的柱子上是沒有用的。</p>
    
    <p data-start="180" data-end="183.99999999">I am afraid I shall never have any brains, after all!"</p>
    <p data-start="180" data-end="183.99999999">恐怕我永遠也不會有腦子了！”</p>
    
    <p data-start="184" data-end="190.99999999">Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind.</p>
    <p data-start="184" data-end="190.99999999">木筏順流而下，可憐的稻草人被遠遠地留在了後面。</p>
    
    <p data-start="191" data-end="194.99999999">Then the Lion said: "Something must be done to save us.</p>
    <p data-start="191" data-end="194.99999999">然後獅子說：“必須做點什麼來拯救我們。</p>
    
    <p data-start="195" data-end="202.99999999">I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail."</p>
    <p data-start="195" data-end="202.99999999">我想我可以游到岸邊，然後拉著木筏，如果你們只要緊緊抓住我的尾巴尖。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="203" data-end="208.99999999">So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail.</p>
    <p data-start="203" data-end="208.99999999">於是他跳入水中，鐵皮樵夫緊緊抓住了他的尾巴。</p>
    
    <p data-start="209" data-end="213.99999999">Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore.</p>
    <p data-start="209" data-end="213.99999999">然後獅子開始全力向岸邊游去。</p>
    
    <p data-start="214" data-end="216.99999999">It was hard work, although he was so big;</p>
    <p data-start="214" data-end="216.99999999">這是件艱苦的工作，雖然他很大；</p>
    
    <p data-start="217" data-end="226.99999999">but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's long pole and helped push the raft to the land.</p>
    <p data-start="217" data-end="226.99999999">但不久他們被拉出了水流，然後桃樂絲拿起鐵皮樵夫的長桿，幫助將木筏推到岸邊。</p>
    
    <p data-start="227" data-end="241.99999999">They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.</p>
    <p data-start="227" data-end="241.99999999">當他們終於到達岸邊，踏上漂亮的綠草地時，他們都筋疲力盡了。他們也知道，這條河把他們帶到很遠的地方，超過了通往翡翠城的黃磚路。</p>
    
    <p data-start="242" data-end="248.99999999">"What shall we do now?" asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him.</p>
    <p data-start="242" data-end="248.99999999">“我們現在該怎麼辦？”鐵皮樵夫問道，獅子躺在草地上讓陽光曬乾他。</p>
    
    <p data-start="249" data-end="252.99999999">"We must get back to the road, in some way," said Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="249" data-end="252.99999999">“我們必須想辦法回到路上，”桃樂絲說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="253" data-end="260.99999999">"The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again," remarked the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="253" data-end="260.99999999">“最好的辦法是沿著河岸走，直到我們再次找到那條路，”獅子說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="261" data-end="269.99999999">So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them.</p>
    <p data-start="261" data-end="269.99999999">所以，當他們休息好了，桃樂絲拾起她的籃子，他們沿著草地開始走，向河流把他們帶走的那條路走去。</p>
    
    <p data-start="270" data-end="281.99999999">It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.</p>
    <p data-start="270" data-end="281.99999999">這是一片可愛的土地，有很多花朵和果樹，陽光明媚，使他們心情愉快。如果不是因為可憐的稻草人，他們本可以很開心的。</p>
    
    <p data-start="282" data-end="287.99999999">They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower;</p>
    <p data-start="282" data-end="287.99999999">他們盡可能快地走著，桃樂絲只停下來摘了一朵美麗的花；</p>
    
    <p data-start="288" data-end="291.99999999">and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out: "Look!"</p>
    <p data-start="288" data-end="291.99999999">過了一會兒，鐵皮樵夫喊道：“看！”</p>
    
    <p data-start="292" data-end="301.99999999">Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.</p>
    <p data-start="292" data-end="301.99999999">然後他們都看著河面，看到稻草人棲息在水中間的桿子上，看起來非常孤獨和悲傷。</p>
    
    <p data-start="302" data-end="304.99999999">"What can we do to save him?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="302" data-end="304.99999999">“我們怎麼救他？”桃樂絲問道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="305" data-end="309.99999999">The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.</p>
    <p data-start="305" data-end="309.99999999">獅子和樵夫都搖了搖頭，因為他們不知道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="310" data-end="321.99999999">So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water's edge.</p>
    <p data-start="310" data-end="321.99999999">於是他們坐在岸邊，滿懷渴望地看著稻草人，直到一隻鸛飛過，看到他們後停下來在水邊休息。</p>
    
    <p data-start="322" data-end="324.99999999">"Who are you and where are you going?" asked the Stork.</p>
    <p data-start="322" data-end="324.99999999">“你是誰，你要去哪裡？”鸛問道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="325" data-end="331.99999999">"I am Dorothy," answered the girl, "and these are my friends, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion;</p>
    <p data-start="325" data-end="331.99999999">“我是桃樂絲，”女孩回答道，“這是我的朋友，鐵皮樵夫和膽小獅子；</p>
     
    <p data-start="332" data-end="334.99999999">and we are going to the Emerald City."</p>
    <p data-start="332" data-end="334.99999999">我們要去翡翠城。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="335" data-end="341.99999999">"This isn't the road," said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party.</p>
    <p data-start="335" data-end="341.99999999">“這不是路，”鸛說，她扭動著長長的脖子，銳利地看著這個奇怪的隊伍。</p>
    
    <p data-start="342" data-end="348.99999999">"I know it," returned Dorothy, "but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are wondering how we shall get him again."</p>
    <p data-start="342" data-end="348.99999999">“我知道，”桃樂絲回應道，“但我們失去了稻草人，正在想著怎麼把他找回來。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="349" data-end="351.99999999">"Where is he?" asked the Stork.</p>
    <p data-start="349" data-end="351.99999999">“他在哪裡？”鸛問道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="352" data-end="353.99999999">"Over there in the river," answered the little girl.</p>
    <p data-start="352" data-end="353.99999999">“在那邊的河裡，”小女孩回答道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="354" data-end="359.99999999">"If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for you," remarked the Stork.</p>
    <p data-start="354" data-end="359.99999999">“如果他不是那麼大那麼重，我會幫你們把他撈上來，”鸛說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="360" data-end="364.99999999">"He isn't heavy a bit," said Dorothy eagerly, "for he is stuffed with straw;</p>
    <p data-start="360" data-end="364.99999999">“他一點也不重，”桃樂絲急切地說，“因為他是用稻草填充的；</p>
    
    <p data-start="365" data-end="370.99999999">and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever and ever so much."</p>
    <p data-start="365" data-end="370.99999999">如果你能把他帶回來，我們會非常非常感謝你。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="371" data-end="378.99999999">"Well, I'll try," said the Stork, "but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again."</p>
    <p data-start="371" data-end="378.99999999">“好吧，我會試試的，”鸛說，“但是如果我發現他太重了，我就不得不再次把他丟回河裡。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="379" data-end="387.99999999">So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole.</p>
    <p data-start="379" data-end="387.99999999">於是大鳥飛上天空，飛過水面，直到她來到稻草人棲息的桿子旁邊。</p>
    
    <p data-start="388" data-end="401.99999999">Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting.</p>
    <p data-start="388" data-end="401.99999999">然後，鸛用她的大爪子抓住稻草人的手臂，把他帶上天空，帶回岸邊，桃樂絲、獅子、鐵皮樵夫和托托都在那裡坐著。</p>
    
    <p data-start="402" data-end="411.99999999">When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto;</p>
    <p data-start="402" data-end="411.99999999">當稻草人再次發現自己在朋友中間時，他非常高興，擁抱了他們所有人，甚至是獅子和托托；</p>
    
    <p data-start="412" data-end="419.99999999">and as they walked along he sang "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!" at every step, he felt so gay.</p>
    <p data-start="412" data-end="419.99999999">當他們走著時，他每走一步就唱著“Tol-de-ri-de-oh！”，他感到非常快樂。</p>
    
    <p data-start="420" data-end="433.99999999">"I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever," he said, "but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her some kindness in return."</p>
    <p data-start="420" data-end="433.99999999">“我害怕我永遠都得待在河裡，”他說，“但好心的鸛救了我，如果我以後有了腦子，我會再找到鸛，對她表示感謝。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="434" data-end="438.99999999">"That's all right," said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.</p>
    <p data-start="434" data-end="438.99999999">“沒關係，”鸛說，她正在他們旁邊飛行。</p>
    
    <p data-start="439" data-end="440.99999999">"I always like to help anyone in trouble.</p>
    <p data-start="439" data-end="440.99999999">“我總是喜歡幫助有困難的人。</p>
    
    <p data-start="441" data-end="445.99999999">But I must go now, for my babies are waiting in the nest for me.</p>
    <p data-start="441" data-end="445.99999999">但我現在得走了，因為我的寶寶們在巢裡等著我。</p>
    
    <p data-start="446" data-end="450.99999999">I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Oz will help you."</p>
    <p data-start="446" data-end="450.99999999">希望你們能找到翡翠城，奧茲能幫助你們。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="451" data-end="457.99999999">"Thank you," replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight.</p>
    <p data-start="451" data-end="457.99999999">“謝謝你，”桃樂絲回應道，然後好心的鸛飛上天空，很快就消失了。</p>
    
    <p data-start="458" data-end="469.99999999">They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them.</p>
    <p data-start="458" data-end="469.99999999">他們一邊走，一邊聽著色彩鮮豔的鳥兒唱歌，看著現在變得如此濃密的可愛花朵，地面都被它們鋪滿了。</p>
    
    <p data-start="470" data-end="482.99999999">There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy's eyes.</p>
    <p data-start="470" data-end="482.99999999">有大朵的黃色、白色、藍色和紫色的花朵，還有大片的猩紅色罌粟花，它們的顏色如此鮮豔，幾乎讓桃樂絲眼花繚亂。</p>
    
    <p data-start="483" data-end="490.99999999">"Aren't they beautiful?" the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers.</p>
    <p data-start="483" data-end="490.99999999">“它們是不是很美？”女孩問道，呼吸著明亮花朵的芬芳。</p>
    
    <p data-start="491" data-end="496.99999999">"I suppose so," answered the Scarecrow. "When I have brains, I shall probably like them better."</p>
    <p data-start="491" data-end="496.99999999">“我想是的，”稻草人回答道。“等我有了腦子，我可能會更喜歡它們。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="497" data-end="501.99999999">"If I only had a heart, I should love them," added the Tin Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="497" data-end="501.99999999">“如果我有一顆心，我應該會愛上它們，”鐵皮樵夫補充道。</p>
       
    <p data-start="502" data-end="504.99999999">"I always did like flowers," said the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="502" data-end="504.99999999">“我一直很喜歡花，”獅子說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="505" data-end="510.99999999">"They seem so helpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these."</p>
    <p data-start="505" data-end="510.99999999">“它們看起來那麼無助和脆弱。但森林裡沒有哪種花能像這些那麼鮮豔。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="511" data-end="519.99999999">They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers;</p>
    <p data-start="511" data-end="519.99999999">他們現在遇到了越來越多的大紅罌粟花，而其他花朵則越來越少；</p>
    
    <p data-start="520" data-end="524.99999999">and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies.</p>
    <p data-start="520" data-end="524.99999999">很快他們發現自己身處一片巨大的罌粟花田中。</p>
    
    <p data-start="525" data-end="542.99999999">Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever.</p>
    <p data-start="525" data-end="542.99999999">眾所周知，當許多這樣的花聚集在一起時，它們的氣味是如此強烈，以至於任何吸入它的人都會入睡，如果睡著的人沒有被帶離花香，他會一直睡下去，永遠不醒。</p>
    
    <p data-start="543" data-end="550.99999999">But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about;</p>
    <p data-start="543" data-end="550.99999999">但桃樂絲並不知道這一點，她也無法逃離周圍到處都是的鮮紅花朵；</p>
    
    <p data-start="551" data-end="558.99999999">so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.</p>
    <p data-start="551" data-end="558.99999999">於是她的眼睛逐漸沉重，感到自己必須坐下來休息和睡覺。</p>
    
    <p data-start="559" data-end="561.99999999">But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.</p>
    <p data-start="559" data-end="561.99999999">但是鐵皮樵夫不讓她這樣做。</p>
    
    <p data-start="562" data-end="565.99999999">"We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark," he said;</p>
    <p data-start="562" data-end="565.99999999">“我們必須趕快在天黑前回到黃磚路，”他說；</p>
    
    <p data-start="566" data-end="572.99999999">and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until Dorothy could stand no longer.</p>
    <p data-start="566" data-end="572.99999999">稻草人同意他的說法。於是他們繼續走，直到桃樂絲再也走不動了。</p>
    
    <p data-start="573" data-end="581.99999999">Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.</p>
    <p data-start="573" data-end="581.99999999">她的眼睛不由自主地閉上了，她忘記了自己在哪裡，倒在罌粟花中，迅速入睡。</p>
    
    <p data-start="582" data-end="584.99999999">"What shall we do?" asked the Tin Woodman.</p>
    <p data-start="582" data-end="584.99999999">“我們該怎麼辦？”鐵皮樵夫問道。</p>
    
    <p data-start="585" data-end="588.99999999">"If we leave her here she will die," said the Lion.</p>
    <p data-start="585" data-end="588.99999999">“如果我們把她留在這裡，她會死的，”獅子說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="589" data-end="591.99999999">"The smell of the flowers is killing us all.</p>
    <p data-start="589" data-end="591.99999999">“花香正在殺死我們所有人。</p>
    
    <p data-start="592" data-end="597.99999999">I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and the dog is asleep already."</p>
    <p data-start="592" data-end="597.99999999">我自己也幾乎睜不開眼睛了，小狗已經睡著了。”</p>

    <p data-start="598" data-end="602.99999999">It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress.</p>
    <p data-start="598" data-end="602.99999999">的確如此；托托已經倒在了他的小主人身旁。</p>
    
    <p data-start="603" data-end="608.99999999">But the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent of the flowers.</p>
    <p data-start="603" data-end="608.99999999">但是稻草人和鐵皮樵夫因為不是由血肉構成，並沒有受到花香的困擾。</p>
    
    <p data-start="609" data-end="615.99999999">"Run fast," said the Scarecrow to the Lion, "and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can.</p>
    <p data-start="609" data-end="615.99999999">“快跑，”稻草人對獅子說，“盡快離開這個致命的花叢。</p>
    
    <p data-start="616" data-end="621.99999999">We will bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried."</p>
    <p data-start="616" data-end="621.99999999">我們會帶著這個小女孩，但如果你睡著了，我們就無法搬動你。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="622" data-end="627.99999999">So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.</p>
    <p data-start="622" data-end="627.99999999">於是獅子振作起來，盡快向前奔去。</p>
    
    <p data-start="628" data-end="629.99999999">In a moment he was out of sight.</p>
    <p data-start="628" data-end="629.99999999">轉瞬間他就消失在視線中。</p>
    
    <p data-start="630" data-end="634.99999999">"Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="630" data-end="634.99999999">“讓我們用手做個椅子抬她，”稻草人說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="635" data-end="647.99999999">So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.</p>
    <p data-start="635" data-end="647.99999999">於是他們撿起托托，把小狗放在桃樂絲的膝上，然後用手做了個椅子，用手臂做扶手，把睡著的女孩抬在他們中間穿過花叢。</p>
    
    <p data-start="648" data-end="655.99999999">On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end.</p>
    <p data-start="648" data-end="655.99999999">他們一直走著，周圍那片致命的花毯似乎永遠不會結束。</p>
    
    <p data-start="656" data-end="664.99999999">They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies.</p>
    <p data-start="656" data-end="664.99999999">他們沿著河彎走，最後發現他們的朋友獅子躺在罌粟花中沉睡。</p>
    
    <p data-start="665" data-end="679.99999999">The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them.</p>
    <p data-start="665" data-end="679.99999999">花香對這個巨大野獸來說太強烈了，他終於撐不住了，倒在了離罌粟花田盡頭不遠的地方，那裡有甜美的青草鋪展在他們面前的美麗綠地上。</p>
    
    <p data-start="680" data-end="684.99999999">"We can do nothing for him," said the Tin Woodman, sadly;</p>
    <p data-start="680" data-end="684.99999999">“我們對他無能為力，”鐵皮樵夫悲傷地說；</p>
    
    <p data-start="685" data-end="686.99999999">"for he is much too heavy to lift.</p>
    <p data-start="685" data-end="686.99999999">“因為他太重了，無法抬起來。</p>
    
    <p data-start="687" data-end="694.99999999">We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last."</p>
    <p data-start="687" data-end="694.99999999">我們必須讓他在這裡永遠睡下去，也許他會夢見自己終於找到了勇氣。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="695" data-end="696.99999999">"I'm sorry," said the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="695" data-end="696.99999999">“我很遺憾，”稻草人說。</p>
    
    <p data-start="697" data-end="702.99999999">"The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on."</p>
    <p data-start="697" data-end="702.99999999">“膽小的獅子是個很好的夥伴。但我們還是繼續走吧。”</p>
    
    <p data-start="703" data-end="719.99999999">They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.</p>
    <p data-start="703" data-end="719.99999999">他們把睡著的女孩抬到河邊的一個漂亮地方，離罌粟花田足夠遠，以防她再吸入花的毒氣，然後他們輕輕地把她放在柔軟的草地上，等著清新的微風喚醒她。</p>
