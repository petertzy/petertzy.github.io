    <p data-start="10" data-end="13.99999999" style="margin-left: 35%;">第五章： 營救鐵皮樵夫</p>
    <p data-start="14" data-end="29.99999999">When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been out chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and looked around her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his corner, waiting for her.</p>
    <p data-start="14" data-end="29.99999999">當桃樂絲醒來時，陽光透過樹林照進來，托托早已出去追逐周圍的鳥兒和松鼠。 她坐起來，環顧四周。 稻草人仍然耐心地站在角落等待她。</p>
    <p data-start="30" data-end="34.99999999">"We must go and search for water," she said to him. "Why do you want water?" he asked.</p>
    <p data-start="30" data-end="34.99999999">「我們必須去找水，」她對他說。 「為什麼要水？」 他問。</p>
    <p data-start="35" data-end="41.99999999">"To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the dry bread will not stick in my throat."</p>
    <p data-start="35" data-end="41.99999999">「把路上的灰塵洗乾淨，然後喝水，這樣乾麵包就不會粘在喉嚨裡了。」</p>
    <p data-start="42" data-end="56.99999999">"It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh," said the Scarecrow thoughtfully, "for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly."</p>
    <p data-start="42" data-end="56.99999999">「身體是由肉體組成，想必是挺不方便的，」稻草人若有所思地說，「你必須睡覺、吃飯、喝水。不過，你有腦子，能好好思考也值得。」</p>
    <p data-start="57" data-end="65.99999999">They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast.</p>
    <p data-start="57" data-end="65.99999999">他們離開小屋，穿過樹林，直到發現了一小股清澈的泉水，桃樂絲在那裡喝水、洗澡、吃早餐。</p>
    <p data-start="66" data-end="77.99999999">She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.</p>
    <p data-start="66" data-end="77.99999999">她看到籃子裡的麵包所剩無幾，女孩很慶幸稻草人不用吃任何東西，因為這些麵包幾乎不夠她和托托吃一天的。</p>
    <p data-start="78" data-end="87.99999999">When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.</p>
    <p data-start="78" data-end="87.99999999">當她吃完飯，正要走回黃磚路時，卻聽到附近傳來一聲低沉的呻吟聲，嚇了一跳。</p>
    <p data-start="88" data-end="94.99999999">"What was that?" she asked timidly."I cannot imagine," replied the Scarecrow; "but we can go and see."</p>
    <p data-start="88" data-end="94.99999999">「那是什麼？」她膽怯地問道。我想像不出來，」稻草人回答。「但我們可以去看看。」</p>
    <p data-start="95" data-end="101.99999999">Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from behind them.</p>
    <p data-start="95" data-end="101.99999999">就在這時，又一道呻吟聲傳入了他們的耳中，那聲音似乎是從他們的身後傳來的。</p>
    <p data-start="102" data-end="116.99999999">They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of surprise.</p>
    <p data-start="102" data-end="116.99999999">他們轉身穿過森林走了幾步，這時桃樂絲發現有東西在落在樹林間的一縷陽光下閃閃發光。 她跑到那個地方，突然停了下來，驚訝地小聲叫了一聲。</p>
    <p data-start="117" data-end="128.99999999">One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin.</p>
    <p data-start="117" data-end="128.99999999">其中一棵大樹已經被砍斷了一部分，樹旁邊站著一個完全由錫製成的人，他手裡舉著一把斧子。</p>
    <p data-start="129" data-end="137.99999999">His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.</p>
    <p data-start="129" data-end="137.99999999">他的頭、手臂、腿都與身體相連，但他一動也不動地站著，彷彿根本無法動​​彈。</p>
    <p data-start="138" data-end="147.99999999">Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his teeth.</p>
    <p data-start="138" data-end="147.99999999">桃樂絲驚訝地看著他，稻草人也驚訝地看著他，而托托則尖聲叫著，猛地咬住了錫腿，弄痛了他的牙齒。</p>
    <p data-start="148" data-end="160.99999999">"Did you groan?" asked Dorothy."Yes," answered the tin man, "I did. I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me."</p>
    <p data-start="148" data-end="160.99999999">「是你在呻吟嗎？」「是的，」鐵皮人回答道，「是我在呻吟。我已經呻吟了一年多了，從來沒有人聽過我的聲音，也沒有人來幫助我。」</p>
    <p data-start="161" data-end="167.99999999">"What can I do for you?" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.</p>
    <p data-start="161" data-end="167.99999999">「我能為你做什麼呢？」 她柔聲詢問道，因為她被這個男人悲傷的聲音感動了。</p>
    <p data-start="168" data-end="182.99999999">"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered. "They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."</p>
    <p data-start="168" data-end="182.99999999">他回答說：「去找一個油罐，給我的關節擦油。它們生鏽得太厲害了，我完全無法移動它們；如果我被好好地擦了油，我很快就會恢復正常。你會在我的小屋子的架子上找到一個油罐。」</p>
    <p data-start="183" data-end="191.99999999">Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she returned and asked anxiously, "Where are your joints?"</p>
    <p data-start="183" data-end="191.99999999">桃樂絲立刻跑回小屋，找到了油罐，然後她回來焦急地問道：「你的關節在哪兒？」</p>
    <p data-start="192" data-end="208.99999999">"Oil my neck, first," replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself.</p>
    <p data-start="192" data-end="208.99999999">「先給我的脖子擦油，」 鐵皮樵夫回答道。於是她給它擦了油，因為它生鏽得相當嚴重，稻草人抓住鐵皮頭部，輕輕地左右搖動，直到它能自由地活動，然後那人就可以自己轉動頭了。</p>
    <p data-start="209" data-end="220.99999999">"Now oil the joints in my arms," he said. And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new.</p>
    <p data-start="209" data-end="220.99999999">「現在給我的手臂關節擦油，」 他說。桃樂絲給它們擦了油，然後稻草人小心地彎曲它們，直到它們完全沒有生鏽，就像新的一樣。</p>
    <p data-start="221" data-end="227.99999999">The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which he leaned against the tree.</p>
    <p data-start="221" data-end="227.99999999">鐵皮樵夫滿足地嘆了口氣，放下斧頭，靠在樹上。</p>
    <p data-start="228" data-end="243.99999999">"This is a great comfort," he said. "I have been holding that axe in the air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right once more."</p>
    <p data-start="228" data-end="243.99999999">他說：「這真是太舒暢了。自從我生鏽以來，我一直舉著那把斧頭，現在終於能放下了，我感到很高興。現在，如果你能給我的腿部關節擦油，我就會再次恢復正常。」</p>
    <p data-start="244" data-end="254.99999999">So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite creature, and very grateful.</p>
    <p data-start="244" data-end="254.99999999">他們給他的腿部擦油，直到他能自由地移動它們；他一次又一次地感謝他們的解救，他看起來是一個非常有禮貌、非常懂得感激的人。</p>
    <p data-start="255" data-end="263.99999999">"I might have stood there always if you had not come along," he said; "so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?"</p>
    <p data-start="255" data-end="263.99999999">「如果你沒有來的話，我可能會一直站在那裡，」他說：「所以你確實救了我的命。你怎麼會在這裡？」</p>
    <p data-start="264" data-end="272.99999999">"We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz," she answered, "and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night."</p>
    <p data-start="264" data-end="272.99999999">她回答說：「我們正要前往翡翠城去見偉大的奧茲，並且我們在你的小屋裡過了夜。」</p>
    <p data-start="273" data-end="282.99999999">"Why do you wish to see Oz?" he asked."I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to put a few brains into his head," she replied.</p>
    <p data-start="273" data-end="282.99999999">「你為什麼想見奧茲呢？」 他問道。「我想讓他送我回堪薩斯，而稻草人想要他給他裝一個大腦。」 她回答道。</p>
    <p data-start="283" data-end="291.99999999">The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said: "Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?"</p>
    <p data-start="283" data-end="291.99999999">鐵皮樵夫似乎陷入了沉思。 然後他說：「你認為奧茲能給我一顆心嗎？」</p>
    <p data-start="292" data-end="298.99999999">"Why, I guess so," Dorothy answered. "It would be as easy as to give the Scarecrow brains."</p>
    <p data-start="292" data-end="298.99999999">「嗯，我想是的，」桃樂絲回答。 「這就像給稻草人大腦一樣容易。</p>
    <p data-start="299" data-end="309.99999999">"True," the Tin Woodman returned. "So, if you will allow me to join your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me."</p>
    <p data-start="299" data-end="309.99999999">「是的，」鐵皮樵夫回答。 「所以，如果你允許我加入你們的隊伍，我也會去翡翠城請奧茲幫助我。」</p>
    <p data-start="310" data-end="326.99999999">"Come along," said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick.</p>
    <p data-start="310" data-end="326.99999999">「來吧，」稻草人熱情地說，桃樂絲補充說，她很高興有他的陪伴。 於是，鐵皮樵夫扛起了斧頭，一行人穿過了樹林，來到了那條黃磚鋪成的路上。</p>
    <p data-start="327" data-end="337.99999999">The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket. "For," he said, "if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I would need the oil- can badly."</p>
    <p data-start="327" data-end="337.99999999">鐵皮樵夫要桃樂絲把油罐放進她的籃子裡。 “因為，”他說，“如果我被雨淋了，又生鏽了，我就非常需要油罐了。”</p>
    <p data-start="338" data-end="352.99999999">It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass.</p>
    <p data-start="338" data-end="352.99999999">能有新的同伴加入，也算是一件幸事，因為他們再次踏上征途不久，就來到了一個有樹木的地方。道路上的樹枝變得如此茂密，以至於旅行者無法通過。</p>
    <p data-start="353" data-end="360.99999999">But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.</p>
    <p data-start="353" data-end="360.99999999">但鐵皮樵夫開始用他的斧頭砍東西，砍得非常好，很快就為整個隊伍清理出了一條通道。</p>
    <p data-start="361" data-end="375.99999999">Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.</p>
    <p data-start="361" data-end="375.99999999">他們一邊走一邊桃樂絲認真地思考著，以至於她沒有註意到稻草人絆倒在一個洞裡，滾到了路邊。 事實上，他不得不叫她來扶他起來。</p>
    <p data-start="376" data-end="389.99999999">"Why didn't you walk around the hole?" asked the Tin Woodman."I don't know enough," replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. "My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask him for some brains."</p>
    <p data-start="376" data-end="389.99999999">“為什麼不繞著洞走一圈？” 鐵皮樵夫問。「我知道的還不夠多。」稻草人高興地回答。 「你知道，我的腦袋裡塞滿了稻草，這就是為什麼我要去奧茲國向他要一個大腦。”</p>
    <p data-start="390" data-end="398.99999999">"Oh, I see," said the Tin Woodman. "But, after all, brains are not the best things in the world.""Have you any?" inquired the Scarecrow.</p>
    <p data-start="390" data-end="398.99999999">「哦，我明白了，」鐵皮樵夫說。 「但是，大腦根本不是世界上最好的東西。」 「你有嗎？」稻草人問。</p>
    <p data-start="399" data-end="409.99999999">"No, my head is quite empty," answered the Woodman. "But once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much rather have a heart."</p>
    <p data-start="399" data-end="409.99999999">「不，我的腦袋完全是空的。」樵夫回答。 「但是以前我有過大腦，也有過一顆心；所以，在嘗試過這兩者之後，我還是更願意擁有一顆心。”</p>
    <p data-start="410" data-end="415.99999999">"And why is that?" asked the Scarecrow."I will tell you my story, and then you will know."</p>
    <p data-start="410" data-end="415.99999999">「為什麼會是這樣？ 」稻草人問。「我將告訴你我的故事，然後你就會明白了。」</p>
    <p data-start="416" data-end="422.99999999">So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the following story:</p>
    <p data-start="416" data-end="422.99999999">於是，當他們穿過森林時，鐵皮樵夫講了下面的故事：</p>
    <p data-start="423" data-end="429.99999999">"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. </p>
    <p data-start="423" data-end="429.99999999">「我是一個樵夫的兒子，他在森林裡砍伐樹木並以出售木材為生。</p>
    <p data-start="430" data-end="443.99999999">When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.</p>
    <p data-start="430" data-end="443.99999999">長大後，我也當了樵夫，父親過世後，我照顧老母親一生一世。 然後我決定不再一個人生活，我要結婚，這樣我就不會變得孤獨。</p>
    <p data-start="444" data-end="461.99999999">"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever.</p>
    <p data-start="444" data-end="461.99999999">「有一個曼奇金女孩非常漂亮，我很快就完全愛上了她。她答應我，一旦我賺到足夠的錢為她建造一棟更好的房子，她就會嫁給我；所以我開始比以往更加努力。</p>
    <p data-start="462" data-end="471.99999999">But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework.</p>
    <p data-start="462" data-end="471.99999999">但這個女孩和一個老婦人住在一起，老婦人不想讓她嫁給任何人，因為她太懶了，她希望女孩留下來和她一起做飯和做家事。</p>
    <p data-start="472" data-end="481.99999999">So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. </p>
    <p data-start="472" data-end="481.99999999">於是，老婦人去找東方邪惡女巫，答應她如果阻止這樁婚事，就可以得到兩隻羊和一頭牛。</p>
    <p data-start="482" data-end="496.99999999">Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.</p>
    <p data-start="482" data-end="496.99999999">於是，邪惡的女巫給我的斧頭施了魔法，有一天，當我正竭盡全力砍伐時，因為我急於盡快得到新房子和我的妻子，斧頭突然滑落，砍斷了我的左腿。</p>
    <p data-start="497" data-end="509.99999999">"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin.</p>
    <p data-start="497" data-end="509.99999999">「一開始這似乎是一個巨大的不幸，因為我知道一個單腿的人不能很好地砍柴。所以我去找一個錫匠，讓他用錫給我做了一條新腿。</p>
    <p data-start="510" data-end="525.99999999">The leg worked very well, once I was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg.</p>
    <p data-start="510" data-end="525.99999999">一旦我習慣了，這條腿就很好用了。 但我的行為激怒了東方邪惡女巫，因為她向老婦人保證我不會娶那個漂亮的曼奇金女孩。 當我再次開始砍伐時，我的斧頭滑倒了，砍斷了我的右腿。</p>
    <p data-start="526" data-end="539.99999999">Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones.</p>
    <p data-start="526" data-end="539.99999999">我又去找錫匠，他又用錫做了一條腿給我。 隨後，魔法斧頭一根接一根地砍斷了我的手臂。 但是，沒有什麼好畏懼的，我把它們換成了錫製的。</p>
    <p data-start="540" data-end="551.99999999">The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.</p>
    <p data-start="540" data-end="551.99999999">然後邪惡女巫讓斧頭滑落，砍下了我的頭，起初我以為我就結束了。 但錫匠碰巧來了，他用錫為我做了一個新的頭。</p>
    <p data-start="552" data-end="572.99999999">"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves.</p>
    <p data-start="552" data-end="572.99999999">「當時我以為我已經打敗了邪惡女巫，我比以往任何時候都更加努力；但我幾乎不知道我的敵人有多殘忍。她想了一個新方法來扼殺我對美麗的曼奇金少女的愛，並讓我的斧頭滑落再次，它直接穿過我的身體，將我分成兩半。</p>
    <p data-start="573" data-end="584.99999999">Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever.</p>
    <p data-start="573" data-end="584.99999999">錫匠再次幫助我，為我做了一個錫身，用關節將我的錫胳膊、腿和頭固定在上面，這樣我就可以像以前一樣四處走動了。</p>
    <p data-start="585" data-end="600.99999999">But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.</p>
    <p data-start="585" data-end="600.99999999">可惜！ 我現在已經沒有心了，以至於我對這個曼奇金女孩失去了所有的愛，也不在乎是否娶她。 我想她還跟老太太住在一起，等著我去追她。</p>
    <p data-start="601" data-end="620.99999999">"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it.</p>
    <p data-start="601" data-end="620.99999999">「我的身體在陽光下閃閃發光，我為此感到非常自豪，現在即使我的斧頭滑倒也沒關係，因為它無法砍傷我。只有一個危險——我的關節會生鏽；但我保存了一個油罐在我的小屋內，每當我需要的時候，我都會小心地給自己加油。</p>
    <p data-start="621" data-end="635.99999999">However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me.</p>
    <p data-start="621" data-end="635.99999999">然而有一天，我忘記了這樣做，而且，在一場暴雨中，在我記起危險之前關節就已經生鏽了，我就被困在樹林裡，直到你來幫助我。</p>
    <p data-start="636" data-end="646.99999999">It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.</p>
    <p data-start="636" data-end="646.99999999">這是一件可怕的事情，但在我站在那裡的這一年裡，我有時間思考我所知道的最大的損失是我的心的損失。</p>
    <p data-start="647" data-end="661.99999999">While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her."</p>
    <p data-start="647" data-end="661.99999999">當我戀愛的時候，我是世界上最幸福的人； 但沒有人能夠愛沒有心的人，所以我決定請奧茲給我一顆心。 如果他這樣做了，我就會回到曼奇金少女身邊並娶她。”</p>
    <p data-start="662" data-end="670.99999999">Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.</p>
    <p data-start="662" data-end="670.99999999">桃樂絲和稻草人都對鐵皮樵夫的故事非常感興趣，現在他們知道他為什麼如此渴望得到一顆新心臟了。</p>
    <p data-start="671" data-end="678.99999999">"All the same," said the Scarecrow, "I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one."</p>
    <p data-start="671" data-end="678.99999999">「不管怎樣，」稻草人說，「我要的是大腦，而不是一顆心；因為傻瓜如果有一顆心，他不會知道如何處理一顆心。」</p>
    <p data-start="679" data-end="687.99999999">"I shall take the heart," returned the Tin Woodman; "for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world."</p>
    <p data-start="679" data-end="687.99999999">「我會要一顆心，」鐵皮樵夫回答。「因為大腦不會讓人快樂，而快樂是世界上最好的事。」</p>
    <p data-start="688" data-end="705.99999999">Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.</p>
    <p data-start="688" data-end="705.99999999">桃樂絲沒有說什麼，因為她不知道她的兩個朋友誰是對的，她決定如果她能回到堪薩斯州和愛姆阿姨那裡，那麼沒有大腦的木匠和沒有心臟的稻草人，或者每個人都得到了他想要的，對她都沒有那麼重要了。</p>
    <p data-start="706" data-end="722.99999999">What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.</p>
    <p data-start="706" data-end="722.99999999">最讓她擔心的是，麵包快吃完了，再給自己和托托再吃一頓，籃子裡的東西就會空了。 可以肯定的是，樵夫和稻草人都不吃任何東西，但她不是錫做的，也不是稻草做的，不吃東西就無法生存。</p>
