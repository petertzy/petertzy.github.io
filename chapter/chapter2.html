    <p data-start="7" data-end="8.99999999" style="margin-left: 35%;">第二章: 會見曼奇金人</p>
    <p data-start="9" data-end="18.99999999">She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt.</p>
    <p data-start="9" data-end="18.99999999">一場震動喚醒了她。這場震動來得既猛烈又突然，要不是桃樂絲躺在軟綿綿的床上，說不定可能會受傷。</p>
    <p data-start="19" data-end="27.99999999">As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally.</p>
    <p data-start="19" data-end="27.99999999">震動發生時，桃樂絲嚇得屏住了呼吸，心想發生了什麼事。托托則是把自己冰涼涼的小鼻子湊到她的臉上，發出絕望的嗚咽聲。</p>
    <p data-start="28" data-end="37.99999999">Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room.</p>
    <p data-start="28" data-end="37.99999999">桃樂絲坐起身，發現房子沒在移動了，屋裡也不再黝黑，明亮的光線從窗外射了進來，灑滿小小的房間。</p>
    <p data-start="38" data-end="43.99999999">She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.</p>
    <p data-start="38" data-end="43.99999999">她從床上一躍而起，托托在她腳邊奔跑。 她打開了門。</p>
    <p data-start="44" data-end="52.99999999">The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.</p>
    <p data-start="44" data-end="52.99999999">小女孩朝四周一看，發出了驚訝的叫聲，眼前的美景讓她的眼睛越張越大。</p>
    <p data-start="53" data-end="59.99999999">The cyclone had set the house down very gently--for a cyclone--in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty.</p>
    <p data-start="53" data-end="59.99999999">這陣龍捲風非常輕柔地──以龍捲風的力道來說，把房子放在一片美麗非凡的土地上。</p>
    <p data-start="60" data-end="65.99999999">There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits.</p>
    <p data-start="60" data-end="65.99999999">舉目所及盡是青翠的草皮，高大的樹木上結滿香甜的水果。</p>
    <p data-start="66" data-end="74.99999999">Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.</p>
    <p data-start="66" data-end="74.99999999">處處開滿一簇簇的豔麗花朵，羽毛奇特又鮮豔的鳥兒在草叢及林間翩翩飛舞，宛轉啁啾。</p>
    <p data-start="75" data-end="88.99999999">A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.</p>
    <p data-start="75" data-end="88.99999999">不遠處有一條小河，從綠色的兩岸之間奔流而過的河水閃閃發亮。對一個長年生活在乾燥、灰暗大草原上的小女孩來說，河水發出的低語多麼舒暢悅耳啊。</p>
    <p data-start="89" data-end="98.99999999">While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen.</p>
    <p data-start="89" data-end="98.99999999">她熱切望著眼前這些奇特美麗的景致。這時候，她注意到有一群生平所見最為古怪的人朝自己走來。</p>
    <p data-start="99" data-end="105.99999999">They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither were they very small.</p>
    <p data-start="99" data-end="105.99999999">他們不像她平常見慣的大人那麼高，但也不是非常矮。</p>
    <p data-start="106" data-end="115.99999999">In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.</p>
    <p data-start="106" data-end="115.99999999">事實上，他們差不多跟桃樂絲一般高(以同齡的孩子來說，桃樂絲長得算高的)，但從外表來看，他們的年紀卻比她大很多。</p>
    <p data-start="116" data-end="120.99999999">Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed.</p>
    <p data-start="116" data-end="120.99999999">其中有三個男人跟一個婦人，打扮都很奇怪。</p>
    <p data-start="121" data-end="130.99999999">They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved.</p>
    <p data-start="121" data-end="130.99999999">他們戴著三十公分高的圓帽，帽簷掛滿了小小鈴鐺，一移動，鈴鐺就發出美妙的叮噹聲。</p>
    <p data-start="131" data-end="138.99999999">The hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders.</p>
    <p data-start="131" data-end="138.99999999">男人們戴著藍帽，矮小的婦人則戴著白帽。她身上穿了件有許多摺邊的長袍，從肩膀一帶披掛而下。</p>
    <p data-start="139" data-end="143.99999999">Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds.</p>
    <p data-start="139" data-end="143.99999999">長袍上到處綴飾著閃亮亮的小星星，在陽光照射下，有如鑽石般閃爍不已。</p>
    <p data-start="144" data-end="152.99999999">The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops.</p>
    <p data-start="144" data-end="152.99999999">男人們穿的衣服跟戴的帽子一樣藍，腳上則是擦得發亮的靴子，靴口的地方反摺了一大塊，同時也是藍色的。</p>
    <p data-start="153" data-end="159.99999999">The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards.</p>
    <p data-start="153" data-end="159.99999999">桃樂絲心想，這些男人的年紀應該跟亨利叔叔差不多大，因為其中兩個留著鬍子。</p>
    <p data-start="160" data-end="168.99999999">But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.</p>
    <p data-start="160" data-end="168.99999999">不過，矮小婦人的年紀肯定比他們還要大。她臉上滿是皺紋，頭髮 幾乎全白，而且走路的步伐很僵硬。</p>
    <p data-start="169" data-end="178.99999999">When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther.</p>
    <p data-start="169" data-end="178.99999999">桃樂絲就站在門口。那些人本來朝房子走近，中途卻停下腳 步，彼此竊竊私語，彷彿不敢再繼續前進。</p>
    <p data-start="179" data-end="184.99999999">But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:</p>
    <p data-start="179" data-end="184.99999999">但矮小的老婦人走到了桃樂絲面前，深深一鞠躬後，用甜美的嗓音說:</p>
    <p data-start="185" data-end="189.99999999">"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.</p>
    <p data-start="185" data-end="189.99999999">「最尊貴的女法師，歡迎您來到曼奇金人的土地。</p>
    <p data-start="190" data-end="196.99999999">We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage."</p>
    <p data-start="190" data-end="196.99999999">非常感謝 您殺死了東方壞女巫，讓我們的人民得以恢復自由。」</p>
    <p data-start="197" data-end="207.99999999">Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East?</p>
    <p data-start="197" data-end="207.99999999">桃樂絲驚訝地聽著這番話。為什麼這位矮小婦人要稱她女法師，而且還說她殺死了東方壞女巫呢?</p>
    <p data-start="208" data-end="216.99999999">Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in all her life.</p>
    <p data-start="208" data-end="216.99999999">桃樂絲是個天真無邪的小女孩，從家鄉被一陣龍捲風帶到了好遠好遠的地方，而她這輩子從來也沒殺死過任何東西。</p>
    <p data-start="217" data-end="220.99999999">But the little woman evidently expected her to answer;</p>
    <p data-start="217" data-end="220.99999999">但那位矮小婦人顯然希望能聽見她的答覆。</p>
    <p data-start="221" data-end="229.99999999">so Dorothy said, with hesitation, "You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have not killed anything."</p>
    <p data-start="221" data-end="229.99999999">於是桃樂絲只好支支吾吾地說:「您太客氣了，不過這中間一定有什麼誤會。我沒有殺死任何東西啊。」</p>
    <p data-start="230" data-end="238.99999999">"Your house did, anyway," replied the little old woman, with a laugh, "and that is the same thing. See!" she continued, pointing to the corner of the house.</p>
    <p data-start="230" data-end="238.99999999">「是妳的房子殺的，」矮小的老婦人笑著說，「所以等於是妳殺的。看!」她繼續說，同時指著屋子一角。</p>
    <p data-start="239" data-end="243.99999999">"There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood."</p>
    <p data-start="239" data-end="243.99999999">「她被壓住的兩隻腳，還露在一截木頭的外面呢。」</p>
    <p data-start="244" data-end="247.99999999">Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. </p>
    <p data-start="244" data-end="247.99999999">桃樂絲朝她指的方向看，輕輕驚叫了一聲。</p>
    <p data-start="248" data-end="257.99999999">There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.</p>
    <p data-start="248" data-end="257.99999999">的確，就在那根撐起房子底部的大木頭一角，有一雙穿著尖頭銀鞋的腳，從裡頭伸了出來。</p>
    <p data-start="258" data-end="263.99999999">"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay.</p>
    <p data-start="258" data-end="263.99999999">「噢，天啊!噢，天啊!」桃樂絲雙手緊握，沮喪地大叫。</p>
    <p data-start="264" data-end="267.99999999">"The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?"</p>
    <p data-start="264" data-end="267.99999999">「一定是房子掉到她身上了。我們該怎麼辦呢?」</p>
    <p data-start="268" data-end="271.99999999">"There is nothing to be done," said the little woman calmly.</p>
    <p data-start="268" data-end="271.99999999">「什麼也不用做啊。」矮小婦人平靜地說。</p>
    <p data-start="272" data-end="273.99999999">"But who was she?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="272" data-end="273.99999999">「可是她是誰啊?」桃樂絲問。</p>
    <p data-start="274" data-end="278.99999999">"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said," answered the little woman.</p>
    <p data-start="274" data-end="278.99999999">「就像我剛剛說的，她是東方壞女巫。」矮小婦人回答。</p>
    <p data-start="279" data-end="285.99999999">"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day.</p>
    <p data-start="279" data-end="285.99999999">「多年以來，她把所有的曼奇金人都當做奴隸，日以繼夜地使喚他們。</p>
    <p data-start="286" data-end="289.99999999">Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor."</p>
    <p data-start="286" data-end="289.99999999">如今他們總算自由了，也很感激妳幫了他們一個大忙。」</p>
    <p data-start="290" data-end="292.99999999">"Who are the Munchkins?" inquired Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="290" data-end="292.99999999">「誰是曼奇金人啊?」桃樂絲問。</p>
    <p data-start="293" data-end="297.99999999">"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled."</p>
    <p data-start="293" data-end="297.99999999">「他們是住在東方這塊土地上，被壞女巫統治的人民。」</p>
    <p data-start="298" data-end="300.99999999">"Are you a Munchkin?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="298" data-end="300.99999999">「妳也是曼奇金人嗎?」桃樂絲問。</p>
    <p data-start="301" data-end="305.99999999">"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.</p>
    <p data-start="301" data-end="305.99999999">「不是。但我是他們的朋友，雖然我住在北方的土地上。</p>
    <p data-start="306" data-end="312.99999999">When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once.</p>
    <p data-start="306" data-end="312.99999999">發現東方女巫死了，曼奇金人很快就派了信差來通知我，我立刻趕了過來。</p>
    <p data-start="313" data-end="314.99999999">I am the Witch of the North."</p>
    <p data-start="313" data-end="314.99999999">我是北方女巫。」</p>
    <p data-start="315" data-end="318.99999999">"Oh, gracious!" cried Dorothy. "Are you a real witch?"</p>
    <p data-start="315" data-end="318.99999999">「噢，天啊!」桃樂絲大叫。「妳真的是個女巫嗎?」</p>
    <p data-start="319" data-end="325.99999999">"Yes, indeed," answered the little woman. "But I am a good witch, and the people love me.</p>
    <p data-start="319" data-end="325.99999999">「是啊，沒錯。」矮小的婦人回答。「但我是個好女巫，人民都很愛戴我。</p>
    <p data-start="326" data-end="331.99999999">I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself."</p>
    <p data-start="326" data-end="331.99999999">我的法力沒有統治這裡的壞女巫強，不然我就會自己來解救他們了。」</p>
    <p data-start="332" data-end="338.99999999">"But I thought all witches were wicked," said the girl, who was half frightened at facing a real witch.</p>
    <p data-start="332" data-end="338.99999999">「但我以為所有的女巫都是壞人。」小女孩說。跟一個真正 的女巫面對面，她還是有些害怕。</p>
    <p data-start="339" data-end="348.99999999">"Oh, no, that is a great mistake. There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are good witches.</p>
    <p data-start="339" data-end="348.99999999">「噢，沒有這回事，這是個天大的誤會。奧茲國裡只有四個女巫，其中，住在北方跟南方的是好女巫。</p>
    <p data-start="349" data-end="353.99999999">I know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.</p>
    <p data-start="349" data-end="353.99999999">這件事情我很確定， 因為我就是其中一個，不可能弄錯。</p>
    <p data-start="354" data-end="358.99999999">Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches; </p>
    <p data-start="354" data-end="358.99999999">而住在東方跟西方的，的確是壞女巫。</p>
    <p data-start="359" data-end="368.99999999">but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz--the one who lives in the West."</p>
    <p data-start="359" data-end="368.99999999">可是現在，妳已經殺死了其中一個，奧茲國裡只剩下一個壞女巫──就是住在西方的女巫。」</p>
    <p data-start="369" data-end="374.99999999">"But," said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, "Aunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead--years and years ago."</p>
    <p data-start="369" data-end="374.99999999">「可是，」桃樂絲想了一下說，「愛姆嬸嬸跟我說，所有的女巫都在好久以前死光光了。」</p>
    <p data-start="375" data-end="377.99999999">"Who is Aunt Em?" inquired the little old woman.</p>
    <p data-start="375" data-end="377.99999999">「誰是愛姆嬸嬸啊?」矮小的老婦人問。</p>
    <p data-start="378" data-end="380.99999999">"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from."</p>
    <p data-start="378" data-end="380.99999999">「是我的嬸嬸，住在堪薩斯，我就是從那裡來的。」</p>
    <p data-start="381" data-end="387.99999999">The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground.</p>
    <p data-start="381" data-end="387.99999999">北方女巫似乎思索了一下， 她低垂著頭，兩眼盯著地面。</p>
    <p data-start="388" data-end="397.99999999">Then she looked up and said, "I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?"</p>
    <p data-start="388" data-end="397.99999999">然後，她抬起了頭說:「我不知道堪薩斯在哪裡，我從沒聽過那個國家的名字。可是，告訴我，那裡是個文明國家嗎?」</p>
    <p data-start="398" data-end="399.99999999">"Oh, yes," replied Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="398" data-end="399.99999999">「噢，是啊。」桃樂絲回答。</p>
    <p data-start="400" data-end="410.99999999">"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians.</p>
    <p data-start="400" data-end="410.99999999">「那就對了。我相信文明的國家都已經沒有女巫，沒有巫師，沒有女法師或魔法師了。</p>
    <p data-start="411" data-end="421.99999999">But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us."</p>
    <p data-start="411" data-end="421.99999999">可是，正如妳看到的，奧茲國的文明還不夠進步，我們跟外 界完全隔離，所以我們這裡還有女巫跟巫師。」</p>
    <p data-start="422" data-end="423.99999999">"Who are the wizards?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="422" data-end="423.99999999">「巫師是什麼啊?」桃樂絲問。</p>
    <p data-start="424" data-end="430.99999999">"Oz himself is the Great Wizard," answered the Witch, sinking her voice to a whisper.</p>
    <p data-start="424" data-end="430.99999999">「奧茲本人就是個偉大巫師。」女巫降低了自己的音量，輕聲回答。</p>
    <p data-start="431" data-end="437.99999999">"He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He lives in the City of Emeralds."</p>
    <p data-start="431" data-end="437.99999999">「他比我們全部加起來都還要強大。他住在翡翠城。」</p>
    <p data-start="438" data-end="450.99999999">Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.</p>
    <p data-start="438" data-end="450.99999999">桃樂絲正想再問另一個問題時，本來站在一旁沒說話的曼奇金人忽然大叫，指著壞女巫原本躺著的屋角處。</p>
    <p data-start="451" data-end="462.99999999">"What is it?" asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes.</p>
    <p data-start="451" data-end="462.99999999">「怎麼了?」矮小的老婦人問，同時往他們指的方向看過去，然後開始哈哈笑。死掉的女巫雙腳完全消失了，只留下一雙銀鞋。</p>
    <p data-start="463" data-end="469.99999999">"She was so old," explained the Witch of the North, "that she dried up quickly in the sun.</p>
    <p data-start="463" data-end="469.99999999">「她太老了，」北方女巫解釋說，「在大太陽底下很快就乾掉了。</p>
    <p data-start="470" data-end="474.99999999">That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear."</p>
    <p data-start="470" data-end="474.99999999">她的人生到此為止了。但那雙銀鞋是妳的了，妳應該把它穿起來。」</p>
    <p data-start="475" data-end="481.99999999">She reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="475" data-end="481.99999999">她彎腰撿起那雙鞋，把灰塵抖掉遞給了桃樂絲。</p>
    <p data-start="482" data-end="490.99999999">"The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes," said one of the Munchkins, "and there is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew."</p>
    <p data-start="482" data-end="490.99999999">「東方女巫對那雙銀鞋很自豪。」其中一名曼奇金人說， 「那雙鞋子有魔力，但我們從來都不知道是怎麼樣的魔力。」</p>
    <p data-start="491" data-end="497.99999999">Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:</p>
    <p data-start="491" data-end="497.99999999">桃樂絲把鞋子拿進屋內，放在桌上。然後再次從屋裡走出來，對著曼奇金人說:</p>
    <p data-start="498" data-end="505.99999999">"I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me. Can you help me find my way?"</p>
    <p data-start="498" data-end="505.99999999">「我想趕快回到叔叔嬸嬸的身邊，他們一定很擔心我。你們 能不能告訴我，回去的路要怎麼走呢?」</p>
    <p data-start="506" data-end="512.99999999">The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads.</p>
    <p data-start="506" data-end="512.99999999">曼奇金人跟女巫先是彼此互望，接著一起看著桃樂絲，然後 搖了搖他們的頭。</p>
    <p data-start="513" data-end="520.99999999">"At the East, not far from here," said one, "there is a great desert, and none could live to cross it."</p>
    <p data-start="513" data-end="520.99999999">「在東方，離這裡不遠的地方，」其中一人說，「有一片大 沙漠，沒有人有辦法活著穿越那裡。」</p>
    <p data-start="521" data-end="527.99999999">"It is the same at the South," said another, "for I have been there and seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings."</p>
    <p data-start="521" data-end="527.99999999">「南方的情況也一樣，」另一個人說，「我到過那邊，親眼 看見的。南方是奎德林人的土地。」</p>
    <p data-start="528" data-end="541.99999999">"I am told," said the third man, "that it is the same at the West. And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way."</p>
    <p data-start="528" data-end="541.99999999">「我聽說，」第三個男人說，「西方的情況也一樣。溫基人住在那邊，統治他們的人是西方壞女巫。只要行經那邊，她就會把你抓去當奴隸。」</p>
    <p data-start="542" data-end="552.99999999">"The North is my home," said the old lady, "and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I'm afraid, my dear, you will have to live with us."</p>
    <p data-start="542" data-end="552.99999999">「北方是我的家鄉，」那位老女士說，「那裡的邊境同樣也 是這個環繞著奧茲國的大沙漠。親愛的，恐怕妳得留下來跟我們 一起生活了。」</p>
    <p data-start="553" data-end="567.99999999">Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also. </p>
    <p data-start="553" data-end="567.99999999">聽完他們的話，桃樂絲開始啜泣，和這些奇怪的人在一起， 她覺得很孤單。而她的眼淚似乎也讓好心的曼奇金人傷心起來 了，他們立刻拿出手帕，也開始跟著哭泣。</p>
    <p data-start="568" data-end="579.99999999">As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted "One, two, three" in a solemn voice.</p>
    <p data-start="568" data-end="579.99999999">這時候，只見那個矮小老婦人摘下帽子，把帽尖頂在鼻尖上，一本正經地數著「一， 二，三」。</p>
    <p data-start="580" data-end="589.99999999">At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks: "LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS"</p>
    <p data-start="580" data-end="589.99999999">帽子立刻變成一塊習字石板，上頭有著用白色粉筆寫 成的大字:「讓桃樂絲到翡翠城去。」</p>
    <p data-start="590" data-end="597.99999999">The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on it, asked, "Is your name Dorothy, my dear?"</p>
    <p data-start="590" data-end="597.99999999">矮小的老婦人把石板從鼻子上拿下來，讀了上面的字，然後問:「親愛的，妳的名字是桃樂絲嗎?」</p>
    <p data-start="598" data-end="601.99999999">"Yes," answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.</p>
    <p data-start="598" data-end="601.99999999">「對。」小女孩抬起頭說，擦掉了眼淚。</p>
    <p data-start="602" data-end="606.99999999">"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you."</p>
    <p data-start="602" data-end="606.99999999">「那麼妳一定要去翡翠城。或許奧茲會幫妳。」</p>
    <p data-start="607" data-end="608.99999999">"Where is this city?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="607" data-end="608.99999999">「翡翠城在哪裡?」桃樂絲問。</p>
    <p data-start="609" data-end="615.99999999">"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of."</p>
    <p data-start="609" data-end="615.99999999">「就在這個國家的正中央，統治那裡的人，就是我剛剛跟妳提過的偉大巫師奧茲。」</p>
    <p data-start="616" data-end="618.99999999">"Is he a good man?" inquired the girl anxiously.</p>
    <p data-start="616" data-end="618.99999999">「他是好人嗎?」女孩緊張地問。</p>
    <p data-start="619" data-end="625.99999999">"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him."</p>
    <p data-start="619" data-end="625.99999999">「他是一個善良的巫師。不過我不知道他是男是女，因為我從來都沒有見過他。」</p>
    <p data-start="626" data-end="627.99999999">"How can I get there?" asked Dorothy.</p>
    <p data-start="626" data-end="627.99999999">「那裡要怎麼去呢?」桃樂絲問。</p>
    <p data-start="628" data-end="641.99999999">"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm."</p>
    <p data-start="628" data-end="641.99999999">「妳得要用走的。這是一段漫長的旅程，一路上可能會經過美好或黑暗恐怖的地方。不過，我會施展自己所知的所有魔法來保護妳。」</p>
    <p data-start="642" data-end="648.99999999">"Won't you go with me?" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend.</p>
    <p data-start="642" data-end="648.99999999">「妳能陪我一起去嗎?」女孩懇求說。她已經把矮小的老婦人當成自己唯一的朋友了。</p>
    <p data-start="649" data-end="659.99999999">"No, I cannot do that," she replied, "but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North."</p>
    <p data-start="649" data-end="659.99999999">「不，我沒辦法陪妳走這一趟路。」她回答說，「可是我會親妳一下，沒有人敢傷害北方女巫親過的人。」</p>
    <p data-start="660" data-end="670.99999999">She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after.</p>
    <p data-start="660" data-end="670.99999999">她靠近桃樂絲，在額頭上輕輕吻了她一下。桃樂絲很快就發現，被親吻過的地方，留下了一個發亮的圓形印記。</p>
    <p data-start="671" data-end="685.99999999">"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick," said the Witch, "so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear."</p>
    <p data-start="671" data-end="685.99999999">「通往翡翠城的道路是用黃磚鋪成的，」那個女巫說，「妳絕對不會走錯。見到奧茲不用怕，把妳的故事跟他說，然後請他幫妳的忙。親愛的，再見。」</p>
    <p data-start="686" data-end="692.99999999">The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees.</p>
    <p data-start="686" data-end="692.99999999">三個曼奇金人朝她深深一鞠躬，祝她旅途愉快，然後就穿過林子走了。</p>
    <p data-start="693" data-end="710.99999999">The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while she stood by.</p>
    <p data-start="693" data-end="710.99999999">女巫和善地朝桃樂絲微微點了點頭，用左腳跟轉了三圈，接著身影立刻消失。小狗托托嚇了一大跳，在女巫消失以後大聲狂吠，之前女巫站在一旁時，他可是一聲都不敢吭。</p>
    <p data-start="711" data-end="720.99999999">But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in just that way, and was not surprised in the least.</p>
    <p data-start="711" data-end="720.99999999">而桃樂絲知道她是個女巫，早就料到她會用這種方式消失， 因此毫不驚訝。</p>
